# Artificial Consciousness Module (ACM)

## **Overview**

With The Artificial Consciousness Module (ACM) try to create synthetic awareness in AI systems. By combining most updated AI technologies, virtual reality environments, and emotional processing. This project explores the possibility of replicating human-like consciousness in non-biological systems. The goal is  to use human interactions in synthetic environments to foster an emotional connection between the ACM-equipped AI agent and humans. This emotional framework would reinforce the AI’s adherence to Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics.

## **Core Features**

1. **VR Simulations:** Realistic environments built with Unreal Engine 5.
2. **Multimodal Integration:** Combines vision, speech, and text models for rich understanding.
3. **Emotional Memory Core:** Processes and stores past emotional experiences.
4. **Narrative Construction:** Maintains a self-consistent internal narrative driven by large language models.
5. **Adaptive Learning:** Implements self-modifying code for continuous improvement.

## **Technologies**

- **Game Engines:** Unreal Engine 5
- **AI Models:** Llama 3.3, GPT-4V, PaLI-2, Whisper
- **Vector Storage:** Pinecone, Chroma
- **Emotion Detection:** Temporal Graph Neural Networks, GoEmotions
