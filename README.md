# Artificial Consciousness Module (ACM)

## **Overview**
The Artificial Consciousness Module (ACM) is an ambitious project to develop synthetic awareness in non-biological systems. It leverages state-of-the-art AI technologies and frameworks to simulate emotional learning, narrative identity, and self-awareness within iterative virtual environments.

## **Core Features**
1. **VR Simulations:** Advanced environments built with Unreal Engine 5.
2. **Multimodal Integration:** Combines vision, speech, and text models for rich environmental understanding.
3. **Emotional Memory Core:** A dynamic system that stores and processes past emotional experiences for adaptive behavior.
4. **Narrative Construction:** A self-consistent internal narrative engine driven by large language models.
5. **Self-Modification:** The ability to generate and refine code for continuous improvement.

## **Technologies**
- **Game Engines:** Unreal Engine 5
- **AI Models:** LLaMA 2, GPT-4V, PaLI-2, Whisper
- **Vector Storage:** Pinecone, Weaviate
- **Emotion Detection:** Temporal Graph Neural Networks, GoEmotions
- **Learning Frameworks:** LoRA, PEFT, RLHF

## **Folder Structure**
- `data/`: Stores datasets for emotions, simulations, and training.
- `models/`: Contains pre-trained and fine-tuned AI models.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for setup, training, and testing.
- `simulations/`: VR environments and APIs for interaction.
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for core components.
- `docs/`: Documentation for installation, architecture, and project roadmap.

## **Roadmap**
1. Initial research and environment setup.
2. Basic VR simulations with multimodal AI integration.
3. Development of an emotional memory core and narrative engine.
4. Introduction of human interaction and iterative refinement.
