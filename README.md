# Artificial Consciousness Module (ACM)

## **Overview**

The Artificial Consciousness Module (ACM) aims to create synthetic awareness in AI systems. By combining cutting-edge AI technologies, virtual reality environments, and emotional processing, this project explores the possibility of replicating human-like consciousness in non-biological systems.

## **Core Features**

1. **VR Simulations:** Realistic environments built with Unreal Engine 5.
2. **Multimodal Integration:** Combines vision, speech, and text models for rich understanding.
3. **Emotional Memory Core:** Processes and stores past emotional experiences.
4. **Narrative Construction:** Maintains a self-consistent internal narrative driven by large language models.
5. **Adaptive Learning:** Implements self-modifying code for continuous improvement.

## **Technologies**

- **Game Engines:** Unreal Engine 5
- **AI Models:** LLaMA 2, GPT-4V, PaLI-2, Whisper
- **Vector Storage:** Pinecone, Chroma
- **Emotion Detection:** Temporal Graph Neural Networks, GoEmotions
- **Learning Frameworks:** LoRA, PEFT, RLHF
