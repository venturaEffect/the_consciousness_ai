"""
Emotional Graph Neural Network for emotional state processing and social interaction modeling.

This module implements:
1. Graph-based emotional state representation
2. Social relationship modeling through node connections
3. Emotional state propagation across agent networks
4. Integration with consciousness development pipeline

Key Components:
- EmotionalGraphNN: Core graph neural network for emotion processing
- EmotionalEdge: Represents emotional relationships between agents
- EmotionalNode: Represents individual agent emotional states

Dependencies:
- torch.nn for neural network components
- models/evaluation/emotional_evaluation.py for metrics
- models/memory/emotional_memory_core.py for state persistence
