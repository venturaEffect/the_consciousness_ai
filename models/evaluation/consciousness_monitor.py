Consciousness Development Monitoring System for ACM

This module implements:
1. Tracking of consciousness development metrics
2. Stage transition monitoring
3. Development milestone validation
4. Integration with emotional and memory systems

Dependencies:
- models/core/consciousness_core.py for main system
- models/emotion/tgnn/emotional_graph.py for emotion processing
- models/memory/emotional_memory_core.py for memory validation
