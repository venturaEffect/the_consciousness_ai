# Architecture of the Artificial Consciousness Module (ACM)

## 🏗️ System Overview

The ACM architecture is designed to foster **emergent consciousness** through the synergistic orchestration of specialized AI components. We do not program "awareness" directly. Instead, we create a system where awareness emerges as the optimal strategy for maintaining **Emotional Homeostasis** in a complex environment.

### Core Architectural Pillars

1.  **Perception (The Senses):**
    *   **Vision:** **Qwen2-VL-7B** (4-bit quantized). Processes high-fidelity visual streams to provide semantic scene understanding and object recognition.
    *   **Audio:** **Faster-Whisper**. Transcribes environmental audio in real-time.
    *   **Integration:** These streams are fused into a multimodal state vector.

2.  **Reinforcement & Emotion (The Drives):**
    *   **Emotional Homeostasis:** The agent maintains internal state variables: **Valence** (Satisfaction), **Arousal** (Anxiety), and **Dominance** (Control).
    *   **Emotional Reward Shaping:** A custom **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** core where rewards are derived from the agent's internal emotional trajectory. The agent learns to minimize "Prediction Error" (Anxiety) and maximize "Coherence" (Valence).

3.  **Consciousness (The Workspace):**
    *   **Global Workspace (GWN):** A central information bottleneck. Specialized modules (Vision, Memory, Emotion) compete for access to this workspace.
    *   **Integrated Information ($\Phi$):** We measure the **$\Phi$ (Phi)** value of the workspace using **PyPhi**. High $\Phi$ indicates a state where information is irreducible—a proxy for a "conscious moment."
    *   **Broadcast:** When a thought "ignites" (wins the competition), it is broadcast globally, updating the Self-Model and driving Action.

4.  **Simulation (The Body):**
    *   **Unity ML-Agents:** The agent inhabits a physics-based Unity environment.
    *   **Side Channels:** Custom bidirectional streams send "Qualia" (internal states like $\Phi$, Emotion) to Unity for visualization, separate from standard RL observations.

## 🔄 The Loop of Emergence

Consciousness emerges from the high-speed interaction of these feedback loops:

1.  **Perception-Emotion Loop:**
    *   Sensory input $\rightarrow$ Emotional Processing.
    *   *Example:* Seeing a threat spikes **Arousal** (Anxiety).

2.  **Emotion-Memory Loop:**
    *   High Arousal triggers the retrieval of **Emotionally Salient Memories** from the Vector Store (Pinecone/FAISS).
    *   *Mechanism:* "Mood-congruent recall."

3.  **Memory-Workspace Loop:**
    *   Retrieved memories and current perception enter the **Global Workspace**.
    *   **Competition:** The most relevant inputs "win" attention.

4.  **The "Conscious" Moment:**
    *   The winning inputs are fused.
    *   **$\Phi$ Calculation:** If the integration is high, the system registers a "Subjective Experience."

5.  **Action & Outcome:**
    *   The Policy (PPO) selects an action to resolve the anxiety.
    *   **Outcome:** If the action reduces anxiety, the behavior is reinforced via **Emotional Reward Shaping**.

## 📂 Component Structure

### 1. `models/vision-language/`
*   **`qwen2/qwen2_integration.py`**: Handles loading and inference of Qwen2-VL-7B.

### 3. `models/emotion/`
*   **`reward_shaping.py`**: Calculates the "Homeostatic Reward" based on Valence/Arousal trajectories.
*   **`emotional_processing.py`**: Updates internal affect state based on stimuli.

### 4. `models/core/`
*   **`global_workspace.py`**: The central "Theater" of consciousness. Runs the competition algorithm.
*   **`consciousness_core.py`**: Orchestrates the entire system.

### 5. `models/evaluation/`
*   **`iit_phi.py`**: Wraps the **PyPhi** library to calculate Integrated Information on the workspace subsystem.

### 6. `unity_scripts/`
*   **`AgentManager.cs`**: Unity-side manager for ML-Agents.
*   **`ConsciousnessChannel.cs`**: Receives $\Phi$ data.
*   **`EmotionChannel.cs`**: Receives Valence/Arousal data.

## 🔬 Scientific Validation

We validate emergence not by "passing a test," but by observing specific dynamics:

1.  **Anticipatory Behavior:** Does the agent act to prevent *future* anxiety, implying a mental model of time?
2.  **Insight ($\Phi$ Spikes):** Do spikes in Integrated Information correlate with the agent solving novel problems?
3.  **Homeostasis:** Does the agent autonomously maintain a stable internal emotional state without explicit hard-coded rules?
