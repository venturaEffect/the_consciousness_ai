# Consciousness Evaluation

This document outlines the metrics and procedures for evaluating consciousness in the ACM:

1. **Integrated Information (Î¦)**

   - Capture connectivity between modules and measure information loss upon splitting networks.

2. **Global Workspace Ignition**

   - Track how often broadcast events pass an ignition threshold.

3. **Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI)**

   - Apply external perturbations (memory wipes, random inputs) and measure system recovery time.

4. **Self-Awareness Score**
   - Query the self-model about internal states, count error corrections, or track introspective queries.

Refer to [models/evaluation/consciousness_monitor.py](../models/evaluation/consciousness_monitor.py) for implementation details.
