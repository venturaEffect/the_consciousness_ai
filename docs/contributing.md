# Contributing to Artificial Consciousness Module (ACM)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Artificial Consciousness Module (ACM)**! This document provides guidelines to help you get started and make meaningful contributions.

## How You Can Contribute

We welcome contributions of all types, including but not limited to:

- Fixing bugs
- Adding new features
- Improving documentation
- Enhancing performance
- Writing tests
- Reporting issues or suggesting enhancements
- **Recommending new datasets for improving the ACM**

### Dataset Contributions

We are always looking to enhance the quality of the ACM by integrating high-quality datasets. If you find a dataset that could be valuable for improving AI performance, particularly in areas like emotion recognition, simulation interaction, or narrative generation, follow these steps:

1. Open an issue on our GitHub repository titled `Dataset Suggestion: [Dataset Name]`.
2. Include the following information:

   - **Dataset Name**
   - **Description**: A brief summary of what the dataset covers.
   - **Link**: A URL to access or learn more about the dataset.
   - **License**: Verify that the dataset is licensed for commercial use.
   - **Proposed Use**: Explain how the dataset can be used in the ACM project (e.g., training models, fine-tuning, validation).

3. If approved, submit a pull request to add the dataset details to the `/docs/datasets.md` file. (Note: This `datasets.md` file is a planned document and crucial for dataset management. Its creation is a priority.)

2. **Clone Your Fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/the_consciousness_ai.git
   cd the_consciousness_ai
   ```
3. **Create a Branch**: Always work on a new branch to keep your changes isolated.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes following the project structure and guidelines.
5. **Test Your Changes**: Ensure your changes don’t break existing functionality. Add new tests if applicable.
6. **Commit Your Changes**: Write clear and concise commit messages.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: your-feature-name"
   ```
7. **Push to Your Fork**:
