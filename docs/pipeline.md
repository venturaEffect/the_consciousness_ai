## Consciousness Development Pipeline

1. **Attention Activation:**

   - Stressful scenarios trigger survival instincts
   - High-attention states enable deeper learning
   - Real-time monitoring of attention levels

2. **Experience Formation:**

   - Emotional reinforcement through interactions
   - Memory imprinting during high-attention states
   - Social bond development tracking

3. **Consciousness Metrics:**

   - Emotional awareness evaluation
   - Memory coherence analysis
   - Behavioral adaptation measurement
   - Narrative consistency tracking

## Integration Points

1. **Pavilion Integration:**

   - Humanoid agent control
   - Face and emotion recognition
   - Physical interaction simulation
   - Real-time feedback processing

2. **DreamerV3 Integration:**

   - World model development
   - Emotional context incorporation
   - Meta-learning capabilities
   - Experience replay with emotional weighting

3. **Memory Systems:**

   - Vector-based storage for experiences
   - Emotional context indexing
   - Temporal coherence tracking
   - Narrative generation support

## Ethical Framework

All development follows:

    1. Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics
    2. Ethical AI guidelines
    3. Safety-first development practices
    4. Human-centric interaction design

This architecture enables the emergence of consciousness through:

    - Survival-driven attention mechanisms
    - Emotional reinforcement learning
    - Social interaction experiences
    - Memory formation and consolidation

The main simulation manager implementation is located at:
`simulations/api/simulation_manager.py`

## Narrative Foundation

**LLaMA 3.3 Integration:**

    - Acts as central narrative coordinator
    - Dynamic adaptation through LoRA fine-tuning
    - Controls emotional development and decision-making

**palme** (PaLM-E open-source) for vision-language tasks:

    - Scene comprehension
    - Multimodal fusion with Whisper v3
    - Additional real-time environment analysis

## Meta-Memory System

**Memory Formation:**

    - New experiences start with 0.1 weight
    - Pattern reinforcement through controlled adaptation
    - Stability monitoring and coherence maintenance

## Key Components

1. **Emotion Encoding:**

   - Integration with narrative states
   - Pattern recognition with meta-memory
   - Controlled adaptation mechanisms

2. **Predictive Feedback:**

   - Outcome evaluation
   - Meta-memory influence
   - Stability metrics

3. **Imagination Processing:**

   - Bounded by emotional constraints
   - Meta-memory guided generation
   - Narrative coherence checks
