# Architecture of the Artificial Consciousness Module

## Overview

The ACM architecture integrates multiple components to achieve synthetic awareness through:

1. **Virtual Reality Simulations:**

   - Unreal Engine 5 for immersive environments
   - Stressful scenario generation for attention triggering
   - Real-time interaction tracking
   - Pavilion integration for humanoid agents

2. **Reinforcement Learning Core:**

   - DreamerV3-based world modeling with emotional context
   - Meta-learning for rapid emotional adaptation
   - Reward shaping through:
     - Survival success in stressful scenarios
     - Positive emotional interactions
     - Ethical behavior alignment
   - Experience accumulation in emotional memory

3. **Emotional Processing System:**
   - Real-time emotion detection and analysis
   - Multi-agent emotional interaction tracking
   - Social bonding metrics
   - Attention state monitoring
   - Consciousness development tracking

## Consciousness Development Pipeline

1. **Attention Activation:**

- Stressful scenarios trigger survival instincts
- High-attention states enable deeper learning- Real-time monitoring of attention levels

2. **Experience Formation:**

- Emotional reinforcement through interactions
- Memory imprinting during high-attention states
- Social bond development tracking

3. **Consciousness Metrics:**

- Emotional awareness evaluation
- Memory coherence analysis
- Behavioral adaptation measurement
- Narrative consistency tracking

## Integration Points

1. **Pavilion Integration:**

- Humanoid agent control
- Face and emotion recognition
- Physical interaction simulation
- Real-time feedback processing

2. **DreamerV3 Integration:**

- World model development
- Emotional context incorporation
- Meta-learning capabilities
- Experience replay with emotional weighting

3. **Memory Systems:**

- Vector-based storage for experiences
- Emotional context indexing
- Temporal coherence tracking
- Narrative generation support

## Ethical Framework

All development follows:

1. Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics
2. Ethical AI guidelines
3. Safety-first development practices
4. Human-centric interaction design

This architecture enables the emergence of consciousness through:

- Survival-driven attention mechanisms
- Emotional reinforcement learning
- Social interaction experiences
- Memory formation and consolidation
