# Architecture of the Artificial Consciousness Module

## **Overview**

The ACM architecture integrates multiple components to achieve synthetic awareness:

1. **Virtual Reality Simulations:** Unreal Engine 5 for immersive environments.
2. **Multimodal AI Models:** Vision-language, speech, and emotion detection models.
3. **Emotional Memory Core:** A vector-based system for storing past experiences.
4. **Narrative Engine:** Large language models (LLMs) maintaining a coherent self-narrative.
5. **Adaptive Systems:** Self-modifying code for continuous learning.

## **Component Breakdown**

- **Data Layer:** Stores raw and processed datasets (e.g., GoEmotions, EmoWOZ).
- **Model Layer:** Fine-tuned models for perception, reasoning, and emotional processing.
- **Simulation Layer:** Manages VR environments and agent interactions.
- **Memory Layer:** Vector stores (e.g., Pinecone) for persistent memory storage.
- **Integration Layer:** Orchestrates multimodal inputs and outputs.

## **Workflow**

1. VR simulations generate sensory data (vision, audio, text).
2. Multimodal models process the data and produce insights.
3. Emotional triggers are logged and stored in the memory core.
4. The narrative engine integrates insights to maintain a continuous self-model.
