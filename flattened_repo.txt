 Using modular neural networks to 
model self-consciousness and self-
representation for artificial entities

Abstract-  Self-consciousness implies not only self or 
group recognition, but also real knowledge of one’s own identity. 
Self-consciousness is only possible if  an individual is intelligent 
enough to formulate an abstract self-representation. Moreover, it 
necessarily entails the capability of  referencing and using this self-
representation in connection with other cognitive features, such as 
inference, and the anticipation of  the consequences of both one’s 
own and other individuals’ acts.  
In this paper, a cognitive architecture for self-
consciousness is proposed. This cognitive architecture includes 
several modules: abstraction, sel f-representation, other individuals' 
representation, decision and acti on modules. It includes a learning 
process of self-representation by direct (self-experience based) and 
observational learning (based on the observation of other 
individuals). For model implemen tation a new approach is taken 
using Modular Artificial Neural Networks (MANN). For model testing, a virtual environment has been implemented. This virtual 
environment can be described as a holonic system or holarchy, 
meaning that it is composed of  autonomous entities that behave 
both as a whole and as part of a greater whole. The system is composed of a certain number of holons interacting. These holons  
are equipped with cognitive features , such as sensory perception, 
and a simplified model of personalit y and self-representation. We 
explain holons’ cognitive architecture that enables dynamic self-representation. We analyse the effect of holon interaction, focusing 
on the evolution of the holon’s abst ract self-representation. Finally, 
the results are explained and analysed and conclusions drawn.  
 
Keywords-  holons,  modular neural networks, self-
conciousness, self-representation. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
Understanding consciousness has been defined as "the 
ultimate intellectual challenge of this new millennium" [10]. 
Since ancient cultures, consciousness has been discussed by 
philosophers, jurists and religious leaders. The word 
“consciousness” comes from Latin conscientia , a word used 
in juridical Roman documents by writers like Cicero [33]. 
Literally, conscientia  means “knowledge (science) with”, 
that is, shared knowledge. Historically, it was first used to refer to moral conscience, as in  Christian Codices [24]. From 
the very beginning conscientia  was associated with 
responsibility (moral or legal) . Now, conciousness constitutes  the basis of modern legal guilt-penalty systems 
[31]. In this sense, consciousness is a kind of self-awareness; it is a condition for cognition.  More recently, consciousness has been focused by 
modern disciplines such as  Psychology, Neuroscience and 
Artificial Intelligence (AI). Especially in AI, an important 
aim is the definition an later implementation of a model for consciousness. In this line of work, the first step is finding 
an answer to the main question: “Where does consciousness 
reside?” Is it immaterial, like “the soul”, or is there a 
physical support - a neural correlate - for consciousness? 
[29]. A neural correlate of co nsciousness (NCC, according to 
[6]) are "neural systems and properties of that systems, 
which are associated with co nscious mental states" [14]. 
Another definition of a NCC,  which may perhaps be commonly accepted, is “a neural  correlate of consciousness 
is a neural system (S) plus a certain state of this system (NS), which together are correla ted with a certain state of 
consciousness (C) [10]. The ex istence of a NCC is widely 
accepted in scientific commun ity, but unfortunately "how 
these neural correlates actually produce consciousness, is left 
untouched" [14]. This is not surprising, because the study of 
consciousness is not an easy task, taking into account the 
"complexity of the neuronal ar chitectures involved, it seems 
risky to draw conclusions simply on the basis of intuitive 
reasoning" [10]. Due to this complexity, Francis Crick opted 
to defer even a consciousness definition to avoid precipitation [8]. 
 Consciousness can be divided in two important 
categories. The first category is similar to self-knowledge, 
which has to do with the ordinary notion of being conscious. 
Many people think that this kind of consciousness is the same as knowledge. Actually, though, it is a way of 
developing declarative memories. Declarative memories are 
memories that can be recalled and told to others. The second category, called “qualia”, refers to the idea that the feelings 
associated with a sensation are independent of the sensory 
input. As this is a more metaphysical category than the first 
one, it will not be considered in this paper. Qualia are 
frequently formulated in questions like, “Why is the colour 
red, red?” “Does the colour red appear to be th e same colour 
to you?” Rita Levi Montalcini, the Nobel Laureate for 
Medicine, pointed out that the three main lines of research 
into the consciousness problem were: the neurosciences, 
cognitive science and AI. This paper is concerned with the 
two last lines, and especially cognitive science.  
 Another important point that is present in the approach we use in this paper is that consciousness research 
must focus on both cognitive processes and beahaviour. The 
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION
Issue 2, Volume 2, 2008
163     Manuscript received December 7, 2007; Revised June 2, 2008 essential idea in AI, proposed by Turing in his test (as a 
measure) and his machine (as a medium), can be established 
as follows: “The brain is just another kind of computer. It doesn’t matter how you design an artificially intelligent 
system, it just has to produce human like behaviour”. 
Nevertheless, this behaviourism is the main problem in the classic AI field. The Turing test, which takes intelligence 
and human behaviour to be equivalent, limits the vision of 
what is possible: from a connectionist or a symbolist point of view, it focuses on behaviour and ignores other relevant 
aspects. In fact, one can be intelligent by thinking and 
understanding without acting. Ignoring what happens in the brain and focusing only on behaviour has been and is the 
greatest obstacle to understanding intelligence. 
Of course, such profound questions are quite 
difficult to answer because our knowledge of the human 
brain and cognitive processes is still poor. Despite the 
limitations we have in this field, some psychologists have made considerable advances by observing cognitive features 
in connection with human – and sometimes animal – 
behaviour. In this paper we intend to analyse cognitive 
features and their relation to the learning process and 
behaviour. From a cognitive science viewpoint, we base our 
research on an analytical approach to consciousness, 
focusing on the self-consciousness feature. We propose a cognitive architecture for self-consciousness  using Modular 
Artificial Neural Networks (MANN). We implemented a 
virtual environment with intelligent virtual holons to test the 
proposed model. Finally, we an alyse the results are and draw 
some conclusions 
   
II. CONSCIOUSNESS FEATURES 
 
Because it is impossible to understand consciousness as a 
whole, the most common approach - as is usual in science - 
is analytical. This means that consciousness is defined injectively, that is, based on the features habitually 
associated with consciousne ss or the features in which 
consciousness is believed to pl ay a role. Bernard Baars [5]  
and Igor Alexander [1] have suggested several cognitive features of consciousness beings. From these and other 
researchers, we can extract several cognitive features that 
must be present in the consciousness phenomenon. These 
features can be divided into three abstraction levels: basic, intermediate and advanced features.  
As we consider consciousne ss as a holonic system, each 
feature can be viewed as a whole and, at the same time, as a 
part of the holonic system. View ed individually, as a whole, 
these features are not basic at all. However, viewed as parts 
of consciousness, they can be described as the building blocks of consciousness. This level encompasses reactivity , 
adaptability , associative memory , learning  ability and 
optimisation . A lot of successful research has been done into 
modelling and implementing these features. 
Intermediate features are the result of a composition or 
interaction of basic features  (level 1). They include 
abstraction, prediction, anticipation, generalization, 
inference, emotion, motivation and imagination. Some 
research has been done focusi ng on these features with 
patchy results. 
Consciousness also include a dvanced features. These are 
complex and require a cognitive architecture composed of features from levels 1 and 2. They include free will, moral judgement and self-consciousness.  As we have already 
mentioned, these features are the hardest to model and to 
find a suitable technology for implementation. In this paper, 
we focus especially in self-consciousness. 
 
 
 
III.  A NEURAL CORRELATE OF SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS 
 
It is sometimes said that consciousness does not have its 
own neural correlate, but it is ju st the sum of all the features 
listed above [5]. Contrary to this, other researchers postulate 
that consciousness is not merely a sum of cognitive features. 
They claim that, once all these features are present in an 
individual, they interact with each other, generating new 
features at a higher abstraction level. As a result of this 
emerging behaviour , “the whole is greater than the sum of 
the parts” [19]. The fact is, in any case, that consciousness is 
always associated with these features. Therefore, a lot of 
research work has been done proposing models for each 
consciousness-related f eature and also possible 
implementations in the field of artificial intelligence and 
cognitive science have been essayed [16] [17] [38] [39]. As 
we have already said, in this paper, we focus on the last feature listed above: self-consciousness   
There are different ideas, and consequently different 
definitions, of self-conscious ness. Some researchers [22] 
[27] make a distinction between self-awareness  (knowledge 
of oneself as an entity) and self-consciousness . Self-
consciousness has been defined as “the possession of a concept of identity, as well as the ability to use this concept 
to think about oneself” [26].  In some animal species, we can 
observe earlier states on the path towards self-consciousness . 
Most mammals and birds can recognize other individuals of 
their species as being similar. This means they have a sense 
of belonging in terms of their species [40]. A few superior mammals not only have a sense of self-belonging , but also 
demonstrate self-awareness . Self-awareness means they can 
distinguish their own image from that of other individuals, which is one of the signs that confirms they have this 
cognitive feature. This select group now lists chimpanzees 
[42], dolphins [35], a recent addition, elephants [34], and of 
course, human beings. 
In the artificial intelligence fi eld, several researchers are 
working on the implementation of self-awareness  and self-
consciousness  in robots [25] or even in software holons or 
soft-bots [15]. Most are focusing on self-image recognition, 
and robots were recently equipp ed with this feature. It is 
noteworthy, however, that a lthough recognition of one’s 
own image implies self-belonging  or even what has been 
called self-body awareness  [30], this does not necessarily 
prove that the entity (natural or artificial) has self-
consciousness . To be able to say this, the entity would also 
have to be able to build an abstract self-representation  and 
also be able to use it as essential information for properly interacting with other individuals and with the environment [27] [37] [9].  
There is no doubt that self-representation  is a key 
component for self-consciousness , because “how can anyone 
have knowledge of you that you cannot represent?” [22]. 
Conscious individuals have internal representations of 
things, but self-representation  is different from this “primary 
representations”. It has been considered as a case of “secondary representation”, which are "cognitions that 
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION
Issue 2, Volume 2, 2008
164 represent past, future, pretended, or purely hypothetical 
situations in prepositional form" [4]. It is evident that self-
representation must be a secondary one, because it is "a 
constructed mental model of oneself that can be manipulated in fantasy" [4] This cognitive structures are closely related 
with perspective-taking be cause “self-recognition and 
spontaneous perspective-taking develop in close synchrony 
because both require a capacity for secondary 
representation" [4]. 
This self-representation  must necessarily be abstract to 
support abstract inference pro cesses. It also needs to be 
dynamic and flexible enough to adapt to both changes to its own self and changes in the environment. Obviously, this 
would be impossible with a static self-representation. 
Contrariwise, an individual need s to learn about itself - like 
humans do –, and its self-representation  would undergo 
changes induced by a learning process throughout the 
individual’s whole lifetime. In this process, individuals interaction has a great influen ce. The poet Arthur Rimbaud 
said  ''I is some one Else'' (''Je est quelqu_un d_autre''), suggesting that we conceive ou rselves through the eyes of 
others" [36]. Indeed, other individuals influence our self-representation because we not  only build a secondary 
representation of the self, but al so of the others. This other 
individuals representations are also a case of secondary representation because "it is not a perception of a situation but rather a constructed mental image of another person's 
perception of this situation" [4].  
By this interaction, the individual construct relations with 
other individuals, and as a result "each individual has an overall repertoire of selves, each of which stems from a 
relationship with a significant other", This becomes "a source of, the interpersonal pa tterns that characterize the 
individual. Each self is keyed to a mental representation of a significant other" [3]. This source of information becomes a sort "narrative center [...] of all subjective experiences and 
memories in a given individual" [11]. Taking this facts into 
account, we consider that firs t of all, a self-conciousness 
model must include both self and other individual 
representations and the close relation between these 
cognitive features must be also defined. On the other hand, because of the importance of i ndividual interaction in self 
building process, we considered that a simulator that includes interaction between modelled systems would be an 
adequate testing strategy for self-consciousness  models.  
Another important and essential feature is to be able to 
reference this abstract information and apply it in connection with other cognitive features. One such feature is self-
imagination . Self-imagination implies the ability to “see” 
one’s own representation, a cert ain conception of what one is 
like. Another is self-inference , meaning the ability to infer 
information and reason inductively and deductively about 
oneself. Finally, anticipation  is another related feature. 
Anticipation is the ability to foresee results taking into account knowledge about oneself. 
Clearly, self-consciousness  is a complex cognitive 
feature. It includes an abstract and dynamic self-
representation , a mechanism for using this representation 
and interaction with other cognitiv e features to evaluate this 
representation for inference and anticipation. This suggests a 
modular cognitive architecture.  Taking these points into 
account, we chose ANN to provide a neural correlate of self-
consciousness in intelligent individuals. Information cannot be addressed without taking into 
account both natural and artific ial information processing 
devices, because information is an abstraction that is only 
materialised when it has a physical representation. In 
particular, self-information has a representation, which, in 
this paper, is called self-representation. This makes it possible to use and process this information. Cognitive 
capabilities like self-consciousness and abstraction can be 
implemented to provide devices with intelligent behaviour, which is the goal of Artificial Intelligence. In this paper, 
self-consciousness, and abstracti on, or the ability to separate 
the essential from the secondary, are built into the holons. 
Abstraction is necessary for recognizing other individuals, because these representations ar e an abstraction of reality, 
which is useful for each holon’s behaviour [2] [13] [32]. 
The term informon is used in this paper to designate the 
basic component of information.  Indeed, an informon is an 
information entity. Information can take the form of data, 
news or knowledge. Information is produced when some 
degree of uncertainty exists. As Sanders [41] suggested, 
information is produced as a result of an uncertainty 
reduction process. Denning [12] defines information as the 
meaning that someone attaches to a data set. Brook [7] gave another definition making a distinction between 
“knowledge”, as a structure of linked concepts, from 
“information” which he defines as a small part of 
“knowledge”. Following on from this, Mason  indicates that 
“information can be viewed as a collection of symbols […] 
that has the potential of changing the cognitive state of the decision-making entity” [23]. 
If we lump all these definitions together, information can 
be defined as “a difference, caused by an underlying process, almost always driven by interest, able to transform a 
cognitive structure through a collection of symbols that has 
the potential of changing the cognitive state of a [holon]”. In a holonic System, holons are immersed in a medium. A 
“medium” is defined as any e nvironment that can transmit 
signals or phenomena. Phenomena appear as information to 
perception. The perception of phenomena is certainly a form 
of information. Signals are represented by a code of signs. 
Signals can be coded to produce signs. Signs are the way in which signals are coded. Sign study and analysis is called 
semiotics.  
Data are signs organized in a certain pattern. Data are 
representations of phenomena , that is, they present 
phenomena again, hence re-present. When data is 
interpreted, that is, given a meaning, structure, relevance and 
purpose, you get news. News can be defined as messages 
that cause changes in receptor perception. News is transported between systems that have the ability to 
understand, assimilate and use it. News that is combined 
with action applied becomes useful information.  
Knowledge and wisdom are two higher level cognitive 
concepts. On the one hand, knowledge can be defined as “news plus action plus application”: ideas, rules, procedures, models, laws, theories that gu ide decisions and actions. On 
the other hand, wisdom is “knowledge plus experience, plus principles and ethical and aest hetic constraints, judgements 
and preferences”. Wisdom can be individual or collective.  
From a formal viewpoint signs have three aspects: syntax, 
semantics and pragmatics. In this paper, from a syntactic viewpoint, each holon’s state, growth and self-confidence is 
represented by a numerical value. Each numerical value represents a state, a growth and a self-confidence level. 
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION
Issue 2, Volume 2, 2008
165 Finally, from a pragmatic viewpoint, each holon decides its 
actions based on the values of other holons. On the strength 
of their “representational” basis, there is no way of telling data, news and knowledge apart, as they actually use the 
same signs and signals. Instead, we can identify how and for 
what purpose these structures ar e used. This way they can be 
categorized. This connects with the problem of the 
“reference framework” for interpretation.  
As stated above, informa tion is out of the question 
without an information processing device. Therefore, we use 
the term holon  to denote the basic information processing 
element [21]. This term is used then to refer to entities that 
behave autonomously and, at the same time, as part of a 
bigger whole. A holon then can be defined as an independent 
element that behaves autonomously and is self-organizing, 
recursive and cooperative. A hol on must contain information 
processes, and possibly physical processes. In addition, a holon must be able to cooperate, because it behaves autonomously and acts as part of a whole. Note that holons 
are not self-sufficient. Neverthele ss, they are part of a whole. 
This is why they need to be ab le to cooperate, a process by 
means of which a set of such entities develop commonly 
accepted plans that they implem ent in a distributed manner. 
As explained above, the ability to cooperate is a must. It 
must be possible to add new entities, and delete and modify 
others in such a holonic sy stem. Additionally, each holon 
can self-replicate, which provides the functionality of 
recursion, self-organization and self-production.  
All holons have four impulses: action, communion, 
transcendence, dissolution. Holons can be classed by the following levels:  
Instruction : this level contains the primary holons, 
cooperative entities that process data. They produce new data and simple news. They ar e specialized and are able to 
perform primitive operations.  
Component : component holon emerges when the 
elementary instruction-level holons are structured 
hierarchically (holarchy); its f unctionality is greater than the 
sum of its instruction holons and it is capable of outputting 
more sophisticated news and/or knowledge.  
Entity : entity holons are formed by means of hierarchical 
relationships between component holons. They have beliefs, motivations and intentions and are able to change their 
behaviour based on previous experience. 
Organization : collaborative entities are called holonic 
organization. 
In this paper, holons are composed of instructions (level 
1), and their final cognitive  architecture has several 
components (level 2). They are, as a whole, entities (level 3) 
because of their data, news and knowledge processing level 
and their ability to change behaviour according to previous 
experience. However, viewed as part of a whole, the whole, 
that is, the system, represents an organization (level 4). A 
holonic structure should consider the cooperation and 
collaboration domain. Each holon, with its own goals within the domain, operates and comm unicates with other holons, 
providing the context in which they can locate, contact and 
interact with each other. 
 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 
 
How could self-representation  be modelled in a software 
system? One might think at first glance that it is quite easy 
for a software system to know its  own state, as any system is able to read its own variables at any time. But that is not 
really self-consciousness . If we apply direct self-knowledge, 
what we get is simply a readi ng of the system state, which 
has nothing to do with self-consciousness. Take human beings, for example, the idea we have of ourselves (meaning 
our qualities, strengths and weaknesses) does not come directly as information provided by our own body, but it is 
built as a result of a learning process. When we are very 
young we have an unrealistic id ea of what we are really like, 
but the longer we live – provid ed our learning process works 
properly - the more realistic our self-representation becomes.   
Therefore, from a cognitive science viewpoint, system 
variables must be separated from self-representation . This 
means that, on the one hand, we would have variables 
concerning holon features (which means its personality if we 
think of it as a feature vector with a different level of development in each variable) and, on the other hand, the 
holon’s perception of itself. As already mentioned, an 
abstract representation is needed  of this personality, as is a 
learning process for changi ng this representation. 
Furthermore, self-consciousness  is out of the question 
without the ability to continuously sense the environment and the self-representation  and then adapt actions 
accordingly. For this reason, a process for using this self-
information in connection with other cognitive features, such as inference, anticipation and optimization through a 
learning process also needs to be implemented. As the 
psychologist Phillip Johnson-Laird said, “Planning and action control requires a self model, including its goals, 
abilities, options and an actual state” [20].  This learning 
process would not be possible if the conscious entity is 
isolated. The self-consciousne ss learning process includes 
interaction with other individuals. Many research works in 
the field of psychology have shown that interaction is 
essential for developing consciousness [28]. Additionally, 
this process also has to be dynamic to allow learning process optimization.     Because of the above features of self-
consciousness  and self-representation  we considered ANN 
to be a good implementation choice. On the one hand, ANN are an adequate  representation for a neural correlate of 
consciousness as they are biol ogically inspired. Incidentally, 
brain processes are quite different from traditional 
(algorithmic) computation. There are no explicit algorithms 
in biological neural systems. Contrariwise, intelligence, and 
consciousness, resides in neuron connectivity. Taking this into account, an ANN is suitable for modelling 
consciousness, as it does not incorporate problem-solving 
algorithms, and cognitive features reside in the weight configuration. Furthermore, as  ANN are modular, they are 
adequate for implementing cognitive architectures. Being dynamic, they provide for dynamic self-representation . 
Finally, ANNs are learning trainable by definition. This 
allows the self-representation  to evolve and be optimized 
throughout the learning process.                   In the case of human beings, self-representation  is not 
confined to an individual having a standard internal 
representation of him- or herself as a human being, as 
opposed to some other species ( self-belonging ), but also 
extends to the abstract represen tation of his or her self with 
his or her unique personality. Therefore, in our virtual environment, we equipped holons with features that 
determine their abilities and behavior. First, we defined holons that had a particular size and shape. Depending on 
these features, the holon has a bigger or smaller chance in 
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION
Issue 2, Volume 2, 2008
166 competitions with other holons. A holon’s size grows from a 
random initial size as time passes. After a period of time, 
they disappear, and a new holon  appears in their place. 
These features were added to prevent the virtual 
environment reaching a state where whole holon population 
was in a terminal status, as this would make it difficult to 
test the evolution of self-representation and associated 
processes. After testing with a different number of growth 
levels, the number of possible growth levels was finally set at ten, because this extended the holon life cycle, facilitating 
learning process. These levels are represented in the virtual environment by increasing the holon’s diameter. Another feature, which can be defined as holon  “state” is dependent 
on factors that we will explain later. Ten “states” (0 to 9) were also defined and represented as different colors: violet, 
dark blue, light blue, dark green, light green, yellow, orange, 
magenta, light red and dark red. Fig. 1 shows holon 
interaction. 
           
Figure 1. Evolution of relative feature weighs. 
In this paper, we consider consciousness as a result of social 
interaction with an internal l earning process. Therefore, we 
created a virtual environment,  with a certain number of 
interacting holons to test the proposed model. The 
interaction was defined as a competition between holons, 
where each holon competes with another (one at a time), for 
example, in a contest. In the virtual environment, the holons 
sometimes attack, and sometimes flee other holons, depending on how they rate themselves ( self-consciousness ), 
meaning their evaluation of the perception they have of their 
own qualities ( self-representation ). These holons were also 
defined with the aim of observing other individuals’ 
behavior to optimize the accu racy of their own abstract 
representation by both learning from their own experiences and observing other holons’ experiences ( observational 
learning ). Throughout this learning process, the abstract 
representation the holon has of other individuals evolves, 
but, more importantly, it also improves its self-
representation . This improves its evaluation and anticipation 
of its future actions.   
Holons perceive growth true to its real value, but state is 
perceived with some error, depending on the individual. 
Initially, these values are set. Therefore, the holon  focuses 
first on learning the relative importance of each quality 
(growth and state) for comp etition through a learning 
process. As a result, a neural network module represents some kind of “competition function” in each  holon. In a 
second phase, when holons have an approximate notion of how to evaluate their own qu alities, the accuracy of their 
perception of others and themselves also tends to improve. 
This means that self-representation  evolves in this second 
phase and becomes more realistic.  Finally, a self-confidence  
feature was added. This feature is defined as the length of the random error factor added for self-representation . This 
way we could generate di fferent self-representation 
tendencies and test their effect on holon activity.  
In the first learning phase, observational learning is very 
important because it allows holons to learn the 
representation function. In the second phase, direct learning 
allows each holon to learn its own qualities and to improve 
its self-perception. 
As our goal is to build a NN implementation of self-
representation and self-consciousness, we define the initial conditions as follows:  
1. Representation Function : This function means the 
contribution of each holon’s  features to its global value. 
This function is initially unknown. Assuming this 
function is the same for all holons; it is only present in self-representation. In the initial state, this function is 
unknown and therefore randomly set. 
 
2. Other holon  global values : These values are 
unknown in the initial state. Nevertheless, they are initialized with approximations (as a result of an imperfect perception). We used a random error function 
uniformly distributed across a range of 10%. We also 
assumed that while the global values are unknown, the individual holon features are known. 
 3. Global own value : In the initial state this value is 
unknown and the first approximation is the self-
representation neural network output. We also 
considered the holon feature values as unknown, and 
therefore randomly initialized. 
 
A learning process is also needed to evolve self-
representation and self-consciousness. This learning process 
includes two different ways of learning: 
 
1.   Self-Experience Learning
: When a holon  has a 
confrontation with another,  it forecasts the possible 
outcome. If the forecast is wrong (the result is the opposite of what was expected), the holon adjusts the 
representation of the other holon  according to reality 
and also adjusts its self-representation to include the 
result function. 
 
2. Vicarious Learning : When the holon  observes a 
confrontation between two other holons, it also makes a forecast of the possible outcome. If the forecast is wrong, the holon  adjusts the representation of global 
values of both observed holons and also adjusts the result function in the implicit neural network of each 
holon. As ANN have just two layers in these cases, a 
Delta-rule algorithm was implemented to adjust 
neurons.

of using self-information to anticipate and decide future actions. Fig. 3 shows the topologies used for each module. 
 
 
Figure 3. Neural Networks topology  
 Clearly, multi-layer perceptrons were used (they were the 
preferred option as they have proved to be universal approximators [17], but any other kind of ANN can possibly 
be used). Each holon is equipped with a certain number of 
ANN. The system is, therefore, a modular-ANN (MANN). The main ANN module contains the self-representation 
(including feature values and evaluation function), and other 
modules have representations with feature values of other holons.  
 
Self-Representation Module   
Each holon  has a self-representation (the ANN topology 
on the left) containing the holon features, and the global 
value is the ANN output.  
The relative impact of each f eature is represented by the 
weights that connect the hidden and output layers. The 
hidden layer input values (f eature values) are used as 
weights in one of the connections between the input and 
hidden layers. The other weights in this layer are set at 0, 
and input values from the input layer are set at 1. As a result, 
processing this multi-layer perceptron returns an output value that represents the global value of each holon from its 
own viewpoint (self-representation). When this global value changes, all the weights can be 
adjusted by back-propagation. Nevertheless, in case of 
connections between the input and hidden layers, these weights are used to calculate new s, g and c for hidden layer 
inputs. Later, these weights are set as mentioned above.  
Note that both the feature values and the evaluation 
function (based on NN-weights) are represented in this self-representation module. 
 Other Holon Representation Module 
 
As we assume that the evaluation function is the same for 
all holons, we only represent feature values for other holons. The global value of these holons is calculated as a weighted 
sum of these feature values. This is represented by the net on the right in Figure 3. 
As a result of this M-ANN ar chitecture, each holon will 
be able to recognize other individuals’ capabilities. Additionally, each holon will have  a self-representation. 
Self-representation means how the holon views itself. This information is used by the holon’s central process to 
evaluate its possibilities compared with other individuals in 
social interaction, as it can  be seen in Figure 4. 
 
 
Figure 4. Cognitive Architecture 
     
 
V.  RESULTS 
 
After implementation, we tested the system with 
different initial configurations where we primarily varied the 
number of holons and perception error range. As a result, we 
observed how self-representation evolved (in each holon) and its influence on later holon behaviour. 
First, we will analyse the evolution of relative feature 
weighting. Self-representation converges at the relative contribution of each holon  feature to global value. This 
means that the individual not only learns more about itself globally (global value) in a second phase of learning process, 
but also learns more about th e relative importance of each of 
its own features. This is shown in Fig. 5.

Figure 4. Features representation evolution. 
 
This chart shows the conver gence of the result function 
for the three implemented feat ures, and, as a result, the 
convergence of self-knowledge for each of the three features 
of a holon. Fig. 5 illustrates how the error level decreases in 
a few steps to an acceptable le vel of about 0.05, and then 
converges to an almost exact perception of each feature in a 
second phase. Fig. 6 shows the relative perception error of 
three holons after consecutiv e contests. Because the first 
holon (in white) avoided contests after the 6th iteration, 
learning was unsuccessful in its case. Anyway, all holons 
tend to minimize their perception error, and also improve their forecasting accuracy.  
 
Figure 6.  Self-representation evolution. 
 
Fig. 7 shows how self-representation evolves 
throughout the process. Again, there are three holons, plus 
their global values (from th eir own viewpoint). In these 
cases error is minimized after an initial period of instability, 
product of the interaction with differently valued holons.

VI.  CONCLUSIONS 
 
As discussed in this paper, we analysed the relation 
between self-consciousness and self-representation . Our 
focus was that conscious indivi duals constantly modify their 
behaviour depending on the representation they have of 
other individuals, but more importantly, depending on the 
use they make of the information provided by their self-
representation. 
With the model proposed and implemented in this paper, 
we were able to observe self-representation  implemented 
with holons and found that was useful for representing: 
 
1. Time-dependent evolution of self-representation  
2. Influence of self-confidence on self-consciousness 
3. Relation between level of interaction and self-consciousness development. 
 
We can conclude that the use of ANN is suitable for 
implementing cognitive features, particularly in the case of 
self-consciousness and self-representation, for several 
reasons: 
 1. Biologically inspired 
 
The human brain is a physical organ, and its thinking part 
is based on neurons. The proposed model must ape this. ANN imitates physical neuron structure, their connectivity 
and mechanisms. As ANN are biol ogically inspired systems, 
they are suitable for modeling consciousness. 
 
2. Non-Algorithmic  
In a physical brain, there are not any algorithms; 
intelligent beings’ thought processes are completely different from the way computers traditionally operate, which is 
algorithmic. As consciousness resides in weights 
configuration there is a neural correlate.  
3. Modularity 
 
Modularity is essential for modeling in cognitive science. 
We have seen that there are many different levels of cognitive features. Some features are composed; others 
interact with each other. Fu rthermore, if a module is 
damaged, the functionality degrades, but the system 
continues operating. 
 
4. Adaptability  
Cognitive architectures with ANN are also flexible and 
adaptable through a learning pro cess. In the approach taken 
in this paper, self-consciousness and self-representation are 
not innate features, but are the result of an interaction 
process. In this process the individual interacts with the environment and acquires capabilities of self-consciousness 
and self-representation through a learning process. 
 
The interaction among perception, anticipation and 
decision processes and self-consciousness has been 
thoroughly analyzed by psychologists, neurobiologists and 
engineers working in cognitive science. In this paper, we 
saw how MANN-equipped holons in a simplified cognitive 
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION
Issue 2, Volume 2, 2008
169 model interact with each othe r and how self-representation 
and self-consciousness evolves as a result. 
 
As we could analyze in this paper, self-consciousness is 
a complex cognitive feature. Despite is not feasible to design a realistic model in the current state-of-art, it is possible, by an abstraction, to  focus on some aspects of this 
cognitive feature. In this paper, we focused on how self-consciousness is based on self-representation.  Particularly, we focused on how self-representation is not an inherent 
feature of conscious entities, but it develops as a result of a 
learning process. An important conclusion, is that this learning process depends essentially on interaction between 
conscious entities, and it can  include both direct and 
observational learning. Of course, the self-representation 
model and the learning processes described in this paper are  
quite far from a realistic model. Nevertheless, they ilustrate 
that it is possible to model a dynamic self-representation in artificial entities that evolves as a result of a learning 
process based on interaction. Moreover, it also shows that 
according to some consciousness’ properties such as 
modularity, dynamic nature and learning-based 
development, Modular Neural Networks appear to be suitable structures for model implementation.

Emotional Graph Neural Network for processing emotional relationships and social interactions.

Key components:
1. Graph-based emotional state representation
2. Social relationship modeling through node connections  
3. Emotional state propagation across the network
4. Integration with consciousness development

Dependencies:
- torch.nn.Module for neural network implementation
- models/evaluation/emotional_evaluation.py for metrics
- models/memory/emotional_memory_core.py for memory storage

The EmotionalGraphNN class uses a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to:
- Model emotional relationships between agents
- Process multimodal emotional inputs
- Enable social learning through graph message passing
- Support consciousness emergence through emotional interactions
