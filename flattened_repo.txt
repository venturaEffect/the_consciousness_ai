Abstract
In this paper, we propose VideoLLaMA3, a more advanced multimodal
foundation model for image and video understanding. The core design
philosophy of VideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of “vision-
centric” is two-fold: the vision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric
framework design. The key insight of our vision-centric training paradigm
is thathigh-quality image-text data is crucial for both image and video
understanding. Instead of preparing massive video-text datasets, we focus
onconstructinglarge-scaleandhigh-qualityimage-textdatasets. VideoL-
LaMA3 has four training stages: 1) vision-centric alignment stage , which
warmsupthevisionencoderandprojector;2) vision-languagepretrain-
ing stage , whichjointly tunesthevision encoder,projector, and LLMwith
large-scale image-text data covering multiple types (including scene im-
ages,documents,charts)aswellastext-onlydata. 3) multi-taskfine-tuning
stage,whichincorporatesimage-textSFTdatafordownstreamtasksand

centricfine-tuning , whichfurtherimprovesthemodel’scapabilityinvideo

detailsinimages,thepretrainedvisionencoderisadaptedtoencodeimages
of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding numbers, rather
than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the number
ofvisiontokensaccordingtotheirsimilaritysothattherepresentationof
videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from vision-centric de-
signs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both image and
video understanding benchmarks.

Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) [7–10] have been proposed for multimodal understanding.
Existing MLLMs [ 11–34] have made significant progress in multimodal understanding.
Image-centricMLLMs[ 28,30–32,35–37],leveraginghigh-qualityimage-textdatasets[ 28,38–
43] that are easier to collect and curate, have demonstrated strong performance in image
understanding, such as visual question answering, OCR, and document understanding.
Beyondstaticcontentlikeimages,video-centricMLLMs[ 22,24,27,30,32,44]musttackle

combinedwiththeneedforlarge-scalevideo-textdatasetsthatareoftenoflowerqualityand

the advantages of leveraging image understanding as a foundation for video understanding.
By extending the robust visual capabilities of image MLLMs, video models can focus on
and better address the unique challenges of temporal and dynamic content modeling.
Inherit from VideoLLaMA [ 45] and VideoLLaMA2 [ 46], VideoLLaMA3, a more advanced

numbers or with numbers among several fixed choices, which is an inflexible and unnatural
way to represent images. To alleviate this limitation, we adapt the pretrained vision encoder
to receive images with variable shapes. This is achieved by replacing the fixed positional
embeddings with the Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). We finetune thevision encoder

❶Any-resolution Vision Tokenization (AVT) and❷Differential Frame Pruner (DiffFP) .
When it comes to data, since we propose to improve video understanding capabilities
based on image understanding, we also develop a pipeline for constructing high-quality
re-captioned image dataset.
2.1 Any-resolution Vision Tokenization
In MLLMs, visual inputs are extracted into vision tokens for multimodal understanding.
The common practice [ 47,48] is to extract visual inputs with a pre-trained ViT-based vision
encoder. The pre-trained vision encoder only receives images with fixed resolutions, which
introducesinformationloss. Toalleviateinformationloss,AnyRestechniques[ 28,31,32]are
proposed to split images into patches with fixed resolutions. Although AnyRes techniques

within an image when extracting vision tokens. In VideoLLaMA3, we adopt the idea of
Any-resolution Vision Tokenization (AVT) [ 30,49] to dynamically process images and

architectures) to handle variable resolutions by employing a strategy to replace the absolute
positionembeddingsinViTwith2D-RoPE[ 50]. WithAVT,imagesandvideosofdifferent
resolutions are better represented with more details included in vision tokens. To make
the vision encoder compatible with AVT, we fine-tune the vision encoder and the projector
in the stage of Vision Encoder Adaptation (i.e., stage #1 in Figure 2) using scene images,
document data, and scene images with texts.
2.2 Differential Frame Pruner
Forvideos, inputs whichusuallyhave muchmore tokensthanimage inputsafter tokeniza-
tion, to reduce the computation demand for videos, we apply a per-frame 2 ×2 spatial
downsamplingbybilinearinterpolationtolimitthecontextlengthwithinacertainrange.
Besides,consideringthatvideosconsistofframeswithoverlappingcontent,representing
videosbystackingvisiontokensfromeachframeleadstolengthyandredundanttokens. To
furtherreducethenumberoftokensofvideos,weproposetheDifferentialFramePruner
(DiffFP) to prune the video tokens. Inspired by RLT [ 51], we compare the 1-norm distance
between temporally consecutive patches within the pixel space. We consider temporally
consecutive patches with smaller distances to be redundant, and the later patches can be
pruned. Specifically,asshowninFigure4,wefirstcalculatethe1-normdistancebetween
consecutive frames in the pixel space and then remove patches whose distances fall below a
pre-defined threshold. Following RLT [51], we set the default threshold to 0.1.
2.3 Construction of High-Quality Image Re-Caption Dataset
TotrainourVideoLLaMA3,weconstructedahigh-qualityimagere-captiondataset,VL3-
Syn7M. All images in this dataset are sourced from COYO-700M [52] and processed using
our proposed cleaning pipeline as below:
1)AspectRatioFiltering. Webeginbyfilteringimagesbasedontheiraspectratios,removing
those with extreme values. This step ensures that the dataset contains images with typical
aspect ratios, preventing potential biases during feature extraction. For instance, images

2)AestheticScoreFiltering. Anaestheticscoringmodelisappliedtoevaluatethevisual

Thisstepeliminatesvisuallypoororpoorlycomposedimages,reducingnoiseandimproving

3)Text-Image Similarity CalculationwithCoarseCaptioning. TheBLIP2 modelisused
to generate initial captions for images, followed by calculating the text-image similarity

using the CLIP model. Images with low similarity are excluded, as they are likely to contain

images are both descriptive and interpretable.
4)VisualFeatureClustering. VisualfeaturesareextractedusingtheCLIPvisionmodel,and
ak-Nearest-Neighbors(KNN)algorithmisappliedforclustering. Thismethodidentifies
cluster centers in the visual feature space. From each cluster, we select a fixed number of
images. Thisapproachensuresdiversitywithinthedatasetwhilemaintainingabalanced

5)ImageRe-caption. Afterfilteringandclusteringtheimages,weproceedwithdetailed
re-captioning. Brief captions are generated using InternVL2-8B [ 31,53], while the detailed
captions are produced with InternVL2-26B [ 31,53]. These two types of captions (VL3-
Syn7M-short and VL3-Syn7-detailed) are employed at different stages of training to address
varying needs.
Throughtheaforementionedcleaningandre-captionprocess,wecreatedtheVL3-Syn7M
dataset, which consists of 7 million image-caption pairs. This high-quality dataset will be a
crucial component in training our model, providing a rich and diverse set of images and
annotations that support strong performance across a wide range of visual tasks.
3 Training
As illustrated in Figure 3, VideoLLaMA3 consists of four key components: a vision encoder,
a video compressor, a projector, and a large language model (LLM). The vision encoder
extracts visual tokens and is initialized with the pre-trained SigLIP [ 54]. To reduce the
numberofvisiontokensrepresentingvideos,avideocompressorisemployed. Theprojector
bridges the features between the vision encoder and the LLM. For the LLM, we utilize
Qwen2.5 models [5].
Inspired by previous explorations in MLLMs [ 24,28,30], we develop video understanding
capabilitiesbasedonstrongimageunderstandingfoundations. Toenablethemodelwith
strong image and video understanding capabilities simultaneously, the training of Vide-
oLLaMA3hasfourstages: 1)VisionEncoderAdaptation,2)Vision-LanguageAlignment,
3)MassiveMulti-taskFine-tuning,and4)Video-centricFine-tuning. Whilethefirstthree

This fine-tuning transforms the encoder into a dynamic-resolution processor, enhancing its

2)Vision-LanguageAlignmentStage. Thisstageprimarilyfocusesonintroducingmulti-
modal knowledge into the model. During this phase, all parameters are made trainable,
enabling both the LLM and the vision encoder to befine-tuned for integrating multimodal
knowledge.
3) Multi-task Fine-tuning Stage. In this stage, we perform instruction fine-tuning using a

we filter images from the LAION dataset [ 65] to include those with clear and readable text,
resulting in a collection of 3 million high-quality images, which we term as Laion-OCR
dataset. For the Laion-OCR dataset captions, we include both the text content and the
corresponding bounding box annotations of the text locations. The caption format is as
follows:

the model’s ability to handle a variety of document types.
Forchart images,sincecharts sharemanysimilaritieswith documentsintermsofcontent
presentation, we only include a limited amount of chart data. These data come from the
Chart-to-Text [75] dataset.
For fine-grained images, we construct two types of data: region caption data and grounded
caption data. Region caption data describes the content of specific regions within an im-
age. These data are derived and constructed from the Ospery-724K [ 76], Object365 [ 56],
ADE20K [ 77], and MDVP-Data [ 78] datasets. These data help the model to understand
the details of the image at the region level. Grounded caption data consist of textual de-
scriptionsofobjectswithcorrespondingboundingboxannotations,primarilyconstructed
from the Flickr-30K [79] and GranD [80] datasets. Both types of data enhance the model’s
understanding of images, supporting moreaccurateobject localization andrecognition in

the model’s capabilities in understanding and processing text within user interfaces. For
naturalscenarios,weleveragetheLaion-OCRdatasettoconstructadditionalinstruction-
tuning data. The instruction-tuning data for OCR consists of the following five sub-tasks: 1)
Text Existence Detection: Determine whether a specific piece of text exists within the image.
2)TextLocalization: Locateaspecificpieceoftextwithintheimageandoutputitsbounding

which image the specified text appears. 5) Comprehensive Text Detection and Recognition:
Detect and recognize all text present in the image.
For grounding images, we select data from established datasets such as RefCOCO [ 90] and
VCR[91],whichfocusontasksofgroundingvisualelementsinspecifictextualdescriptions.
For multi-image scenes, we leverage the Demon-Full [ 92] and Contrastive-Caption [ 93]
datasets. The Demon-Full dataset is particularly valuable as it includes various tasks in-
volving multi-image scenes, such as comparing differences between two images, generating
captions for the final image in a comic strip, completing missing text in images with oc-
cludedportions,determiningwhethermultipleimagesbelongtothesamecategory,and
more. These tasks help the model handle complex scenarios involving multiple images, pro-
viding a more comprehensive understanding of how visual information can be interpreted
across a series of related images. At the same time, such multi-image data further enhances
the model’s video understanding capabilities.
For the video data used in this stage, we incorporate commonly used high-quality video

In addition, we further expand the data scale and strengthen the model by synthesizing
dense captions and QAs of specific aspects. Specifically, following the pipeline proposed in
[24], we first filter 68K dynamic videos from Panda-70M [ 112] dataset by optical flow, and
thenemployQwen2-VL-72B[ 30]togeneratediversedensecaptionsandQAsforeachvideo

3.3 Implementation Details
In this part, we briefly introduce the implementation details of each training stage. For
allstages,weadoptthecosinelearningratescheduler. Thewarmupratioofthelearning
rate is set as 0.03. The maximum token length is set as 16384, while the maximum token
length for vision tokens is set as 10240. In the stage of Vision Encoder Adaptation, when
training VideoLLaMA3-2B, we initialize the vision encoder with the pre-trained weights of
SigLIP[54]andtheLLMwiththepre-trainedweightsofQwen2.5-2B[ 5]. ForVideoLLaMA3-
7B, the vision encoder is initialized with the fine-tuned SigLIP weights in VideoLLaMA3-2B
andtheLLMisinitializedwithQwen2.5-7B[ 5]. Theprojectorisimplementedasatwo-layer

theremainingstages,thelearningratesfortheLLM,theprojector,andthevisionencoder

applied in the multi-task fine-tuning stage and the video-centric fine-tuning stage where
video data is involved. The threshold to discard similar visual tokens is 0.1. To limit context
length, the visual tokens of videos are spatially downsampled after vision encoder by a
factorof 2usingbilinearinterpolation. Thevisualtokensofimagesareonlydownsampledin

4.2 Video-based Evaluation
4.2.1 Baselines
To comprehensively evaluate the video performance of VideoLLaMA3, we compare it with
a diverse set of baseline models. Similar to image evaluation, there are few available models
witha2Bparametersizeinthecommunity. Weselectseveralstrongbaselines, including
Apollo-2B [ 14], InternVL2.5-2B [ 32], and Qwen2VL-2B [ 30]. For the 7B model, we compare
it with general models such as Qwen2VL-8B [ 30], InternVL2.5-8B [ 32], and NVILA [ 36],
as well as proprietary models like LLaVA-Video [ 24], Apollo-7B [ 14], and our previous
generation model, VideoLLaMA2 [46].
4.2.2 Benchmarks
The video understanding capabilities of VideoLLaMA3 are systematically evaluated across
threecoredimensions: generalunderstanding,temporalreasoning,andlong-formvideo
comprehension.
General Video Understanding. We assess VideoLLaMA3’s general video understanding
capabilities through established benchmarks: (1) Multi-Choice Video Question Answer-
ing(MC-VQA)tasks,includingMVBench[ 26],VideoMME[ 126],EgoSchema[ 127],and
Perception-Test [ 128]. (2) Open-Ended Video Question Answering (OE-VQA) tasks, includ-
ing ActivityNet-QA [ 129] and VCGBench [ 25]. This evaluation suite follows the protocol of
VideoLLaMA2 [ 46]. We also run evaluations on MMVU [ 130] which includes both the task
types mentioned above.
Long Video Understanding. To further examine the capacity of VideoLLaMA3 to process
and comprehend long-form video content, we assess performance on three long-video
15
understanding (LVU) benchmarks: (1) MLVU [ 131]: diverse long-video understanding
tasksforvideosrangingfrom3minutestomorethan2hours, (2)LongVideoBench[ 132]:
videoreasoningoverthereferredcontextwithinlongvideo-languageinterleavedinputs,
and (3) LVBench [133]: extreme long video understanding.
Video Temporal Reasoning. To assess the temporal awareness and reasoning capabilities
of VideoLLaMA3, we conduct evaluations on the following tasks: (1) Temporal Perception
and Reasoning tasks, including TempCompass [ 134] and NextQA [ 135]; and (2) Temporal
SentenceGroundingtaskonCharades-STA[ 108]benchmark,withmeanIntersectionover
Union (mIoU) metric.
4.2.3 Evaluation Protocols
We expand the max number of visual tokens to 16K when evaluating our models on video-
based benchmarks, ensuring that each frame corresponds to a reasonable number of tokens
andthetotalcontext lengthiswithinthemaximumrange ofthebaseLLM.Themaximum

For general multi-chocies question answering evaluation, we follow the official setting to
constructtheinstructionusingprovidedquestionsandoptions. Anadditionpromptlike

model response are extracted by regular expression, and then treated as one or multiple
time intervals. Based on this strategy, we finally report the mIoU bewteen the ground-truth
intervals and the predicted intervals.

Question : What do you think of 
this stock? Is it worth holding? 
Why?VideoLLaMA  3: The stock  shown  in this chart  appears  to be 
a volatile  and potentially  risky  investment . The price  has been  
fluctuating  significantly,  with sharp  peaks  and drops . This kind of 
volatility  can be indicative  of a stock  that is not stable  or reliable . 
While  the MACD  indicator  shows  some  positive  momentum , 
suggesting  potential  for future  growth,  the overall  pattern  of the 
stock  price  is concerning . The large  red candlesticks  at the bottom  
of the chart  indicate  significant  selling  pressure,  which  could  be a 
sign of investor  uncertainty  or negative  news  affecting  the stock . 
Without  more  context  about  the company's  fundamentals,  industry  
trends,  or market  conditions,  it's difficult  to make  a definitive  
recommendation . However,  based  solely  on the price  action  shown  
in this chart,  I would  advise  caution . The stock  seems  to be 
experiencing  high volatility,  which  increases  risk for investors . If 
you're  considering  holding  this stock,  l'd suggest  doing  thorough  
research  and possibly  diversifying  your portfolio  to mitigate  risk. It 
might  be better  to wait for more  stable  price  action  or consider  
alternative  investments  that appear  less volatile .
Question : Which model do you think is the strongest? Why?
VideoLLaMA  3: The strongest  model  in the graph  is Qwen 2-VL-7B, as it has the highest  average  
performance  and the most  activated  parameters . This suggests  that it has a more  powerful  architecture  and is 
better  at processing  visual  information .
Question : Which model do you think is the optimal? Why?
VideoLLaMA  3: The optimal  model  in the graph  is DeepSeek -VL2, as it has a good  balance  between  
average  performance  and activated  parameters . It performs  well without  being  overly  complex,  making  it a good  
choice  for applications  that require  high  performance  but also need  to be efficient .

Question : What is this 
image designed for? 
What do you think are 
the shortcomings of 
the design of this 
poster? How can it be 
improved?VideoLLaMA  3: This image  appears  to be designed  as a poster  for a 
Fall Festival  planning  meeting . The main  text “Planning Meeting”  is 
prominently  displayed,  followed  by “FallFestival”  in a larger,  more  decorative  
font.The design  hassome  shortcomings :1. Lack  of visual  hierarchy : The text
doesn‘t  clearly  differentiate  between  the meeting  and the festival .2. 
Insufficient  information : It doesn’t  provide details  about  the date,  time,  
location,  or purpose  of themeeting .3. Limited  color  palette : The use of green  
andorange  leaves  on a white  background  might  not be very eye-catching  or 
memorable .To improve  this design :1.Add a clear  visual  hierarchy  by using  
different  font sizes and styles  for “Planning  Meeting”  and “Fall  Festival .”2.
Include  essential  details  like date,  time,  and location below  the main  text.3. 
Use a more  vibrant  color  scheme that stands  out, perhaps  incorporating  autumn  
colors like reds,  yellows,  and oranges .4. Consider  adding  asmall  icon or 
graphic  related  to fall (e.g., a pumpkin  oracorn)  to make  it more  visually  
appealing .5. Ensure  thetext is legible  and easy to read,  especially  from  a
distance .By addressing  these  issues,  the poster  would become  more  effective  
at communicating  important information  and attracting  attention  to the Fall 
Festival planning  meeting .
Question : Please parse all the text in 
the document, from left to right, from 
top to bottom.
VideoLLaMA  3: Here  is the text from  the document : Whilst  
the problem  of wear  is present,  the results  are still excellent  when  
compared  with the results  from metal -on-metal  given  above . When  
dealing  with patients,  a modification  to something  that is very 
successful  would  appear  to be a safer  and more  appropriate  solution . 
Problem :- Femoral  Heads
A major  problem  is in vivo damage  to metal  femoral  heads . (Isaac  et 
al, 1992 ; Jasty  et al, 1994 ). Relatively  small  amounts  of damage  can 
produce  dramatic  effects :
".... a single  transverse  scratch  can increase  the wear  rate of the 
polyethylene  to a remarkable  extent .”
Dowson  et al (1987 )
However,  ceramic  femoral  heads  have  been  shown  to behave  in 
significantly  different  ways :
"A ceramic  femoral  head  is not only less prone  to damage  by 
particles  of bone  cement  in three  body  wear  processes,  but any 
damage  produced  is less likely  to cause  increased  wear  rates  of 
UHMWPE  acetabular  cups.”
Cooper  et al (1991 )
This has been  shown  to have  significant  effects  on clinical  wear  rates :
Wear  rate, metal  head :- 0.10mm per year
Wear  rate, ceramic  head :- 0.03mm per year
Schuller  and Marti  (1990 )
It has also been  shown  that the new generation  of Zirconia  ceramics  
perform  significantly  better  as a bearing  surface  than the current  
generation  of Alumina  ceramics  offering  a further  45% reduction  in 
polyethylene  wear  (Kumar  et al, 1991 )
It has further  been  shown  that femoral  head -size affects  volumetric  
wear  rates…

Question : What part of a 
basketball game is this?VideoLLaMA  3: This appears  to be a free throw  situation  in a 
basketball  game . The player  wearing  number  23 is standing  at the free 
throw  line, which  is typically  located  15 feet from  the basket . He's 
holding  the ball and preparing  to take a shot,  with his arms  raised  above  
his head  in the classic  free throw  stance . The presence  of other  players  on 
the court,  including  those  wearing  green  jerseys,  suggests  this is during  
an actual  game  rather  than a practice  session . The crowd  visible  in the 
background  further  supports  that this is taking  place  during  an official
match . Free throws  are a crucial  part of basketball,  often  occurring  after 
fouls  or technical  violations . This moment  captures  the tension  and focus  
as the player  attempts  to score  points  for his team .

These models leverage joint instruction tuning on video-audio datasets [ 158–160] to cap-

in streaming video understanding focus on real-time processing [ 161–165], employing
techniqueslikeadaptivememoryandincrementalprocessingfortaskssuchasliveevent
detection and real-time captioning. Previous works [ 14,19,22,24,142,149] typically follow
a training recipe that involves an alignment phase, followed by supervised fine-tuning, with
instruction-tuning datasets [ 18,24–27] often being video dominant. However, we propose a
vision-centrictraining paradigmto enhancevideounderstanding capabilitiesby focusing
on large-scale image understanding pre-training. This approach leverages high-quality
image-text datasets to build robust vision encoders that are then adapted for video tasks.
Multimodal LLMs for General Vision Understanding. Recently, a growing number of
generalMLLMshavebeendevelopedtoprocessbothimagesandvideos. While,inprinciple,
models designed to handle multiple images are inherently capable of processing video data,
achieving optimal performance requires dedicated training on video-specific datasets.

adapting model architectures by incorporating a hybrid design of Mamba and Transformer
blocks or training with extensive long video datasets to support extended input and output
sequences.

6 Discussion, Limitations, and Future Work
6.1 Discussion
TheintroductionofVideoLLaMA3marksasignificantadvancementintherealmofMLLMs,
particularly in bridging the gap between image and video understanding. By adopting a
vision-centric training paradigm, VideoLLaMA3 leverages the robustness of image-centric
data to enhance video comprehension, effectively mitigating the challenge associated with
temporal dynamics and the complexity of video data. This approach underscores the
inferent value of high-quality image-text datasets, which are more readily available and
easier to curate compared to their video-text counterparts. The success of VideoLLaMA3 on
diversebenchmarks,includingVideoMME,PerceptionTest,MLVU,DocVQA,andMathVista,
demonstrates its versatility and efficacy across various multimodal tasks.
24
The model’s ability to maintain strong performance in both image and video domains
highlightstheeffectivenessofourvision-centricframeworkdesigns. Specifically,thedynamic
resolution adaptation and vision token compression strategies facilitate a more flexible and
efficientrepresentationofvisualinputs,enablingthemodeltohandleawiderangeofimage
andvideoformatswithminimalinformationloss. Thisflexibilityiscrucialforreal-world
applications where visual data can vary significantly in resolution and aspect ratio.
Furthermore,themulti-taskfine-tuningstageofourtrainingparadigmcontributestothe
model’s robust generalization capabilities. By exposing VideoLLaMA3 to a variety of down-
stream tasks, including interactive question answering and video captioning, the model
develops a comprehensive understanding of both static and dynamic visual information.
ThiscomprehensivetrainingenablesVideoLLaMA3toexcelnotonlyinstandardbenchmarks
but also in specialized tasks that require nuanced comprehension of visual content.
6.2 Limitations
Despite the impressive performance of VideoLLaMA3, several limitations must be acknowl-
edged.
Video Data Quality and Diversity. While leveraging large-scale image-text datasets has
proven beneficial, the quality and diversity of video-text datasets remain a constraint. Video
data often suffer from lower annotation quality and limited diversity, which can impede the
model’s ability to generalize across different video domains and genres.
Real-timeProcessing. Thecurrentmodelarchitecturemaynotbeoptimizedforreal-time
video processing tasks, which is essential for applications such as autonomous driving and
livevideoanalytics. Thecomputationaloverheadassociatedwithprocessinghigh-resolution
and lengthy video inputs can hinder real-time performance.
Generalization to Unseen Modalities. While VideoLLaMA3 excels in image and video
understanding, its capability to generalize to other modalities, such as audio or speech data,
remainsunexplored. Integratingadditionalmodalitiescouldfurtherenhancethemodel’s
multimodal comprehension but poses significant challenges in terms of architecture and
training.
6.3 Future Work
Building on the foundations laid by VideoLLaMA3, several avenues for future research are
proposed to address the identified limitations and further enhance the model’s capabilities.
Enhanced Video-Text Datasets. Investing in the creation and curation of higher quality
and more diverse video-text datasets will be crucial. Incorporating annotations that capture
nuancedtemporalandcontextualinformationcansignificantlyimprovethemodel’stemporal
understanding and generalization across different video domains.
Real-time Inference Optimization. Optimizing the model architecture for real-time in-
ference by reducinglatency andimproving processingspeed isessentialforapplications
requiring immediate responses. Techniques such as model acceleration, parallel processing,
and efficient tokenization strategies can contribute to achieving real-time performance.
Multimodal Expansion. Extending VideoLLaMA3 to incorporate additional modalities
like audio, speech, and sensor data can create a more holistic understanding of multimodal
inputs. Researchintounifiedarchitecturesthatseamlesslyintegratemultipledatatypeswill
be pivotal in achieving comprehensive multimodal intelligence.
Advanced Post-Training Techniques. Implementing more sophisticated post-training
methodologies,suchasscalingRLtechniquesforMLLMs,canfurtherrefineVideoLLaMA3’s
performance. RLHF and other RL-based approaches can be employed to better align the
model’s outputs with human preferences and task-specific requirements. Scaling these RL
techniquestoaccommodatethecomplexitiesofmultimodaldatawillenhancethemodel’s
ability to generate more accurate, contextually appropriate, and user-aligned responses,
thereby advancing its overall multimodal intelligence.

addressing its current limitations through targeted research and development will pave the
way for even more powerful and versatile models in the future.

# Simulation Guide for Building ACM Training Scenarios on Unreal Engine 5

This guide outlines the approach for setting up simulation scenarios in Unreal Engine that are specifically designed to train the Artificial Consciousness Module (ACM) using emotional reinforcement learning. The ACM project is based on principles observed in organic consciousness development in mammals. A stratified accumulation of ancestral experiences, captured as emotional and instinctive responses.

---

## 1. Overview

### Organic Consciousness Principles

- **Stratified Experiences:** Consciousness in mammals evolves from layered, inherited experiences. Our ACM emulates this by accumulating emotional rewards from interactions in simulations. Each interaction represents a building block of ancestral memory.
- **Instinct & Emotional Response:** The agent’s behavior evolves through basic instinctive responses at early simulation stages, eventually developing into complex social behaviors (e.g., love, sadness, self-awareness).

### Goal

- **Incremental Complexity:** Begin with simple survival or interaction scenarios and gradually increase the complexity to include social interactions, communication, and self-reflection.
- **Meta-Memory Storage:** Emotional rewards are treated as meta-memory that not only guide the reinforcement learning process but also serve as feedback to fine-tune foundational models (and act as LoRAs for image/video generation) during simulated reflective thinking.

---

## 2. Setting Up the Unreal Engine Environment

### Environment Configuration

- **Install Unreal Engine 5:** Follow the official installation guide for Unreal Engine 5.
- **Project Setup:** Create a new VR or simulation project. Organize your project structure with folders for maps, assets, and blueprints.
- **AI Tools Integration:**
  - **Behavior Trees and AI Controllers:** Utilize Unreal's Behavior Trees for decision making and AI Controllers to manage agents.
  - **Dynamic Event Systems:** Set up event triggers (using Blueprints or C++ code) that capture simulation events (e.g., danger, social encounters).
  - **Integration Plugins:** Look for plugins that support face recognition, emotion detection, or real-time analytics, such as:
    - **FaceFX** – for facial animation and emotion mapping.
    - **Live Link Face** – to stream facial capture data into Unreal.
    - **AI-Assisted Tools:** Consider third-party AI copilot tools that integrate within Unreal Editor to assist in simulation development.

---

## 3. Simulation Scenarios Development

### Stage 1: Simple Interactions

- **Basic Survival:** Create scenarios where an agent navigates an environment with basic challenges (obstacles, limited resources).
- **Instinctive Responses:** Trigger simple emotional cues (fear, hunger) which will produce initial emotional rewards.
- **Code Example:**

  ```python
  # python: simulations/enviroments/simple_survival.py
  def step(self, action: Dict) -> tuple:
      # Basic environment step
      next_state, reward, done, info = super().step(action)
      # Capture basic instinctual reaction
      info['emotional_context'] = simple_emotion_calculation(next_state)
      return next_state, reward, done, info
  ```

### Stage 2: Advanced Social Interactions

- **Complex Scenarios:** Develop environments where multiple agents interact. Introduce social cues such as cooperation, competition, expressions of empathy (love, sadness).
- **Emotional Feedback Loop:** Integrate face recognition/emotion detection using Unreal plugins:
  - Capture facial expressions.
  - Map expressions to emotional states.
- **Code Example with Unreal Integration:**

  ```python
  # python: simulations/enviroments/advanced_social.py
  def step(self, action: Dict) -> tuple:
      next_state, reward, done, info = super().step(action)
      # Obtain real-time facial emotion from Unreal's face recognition plugin
      if self.face_recognition:
          facial_emotion = self.face_recognition.detect_emotion()
          info['facial_emotion'] = facial_emotion
      # Update contextual emotional state
      info['emotional_context'] = compute_emotion(next_state, facial_emotion)
      return next_state, reward, done, info
  ```

---

## 4. Reinforcement Learning Loop with Emotional Rewards

### Simulation Manager Responsibilities

- **Interaction Episodes:** Manage episodes where the agent interacts with the environment.
- **Reward Shaping:** Combine environmental rewards with emotional signals to calculate a composite emotional reward.
- **Memory and Meta-Memory:** Store each interaction’s emotional reward as meta-memory guiding both present behavior and future fine-tuning of models.

### Sample Interaction Loop:

```python
# python: simulations/api/simulation_manager.py
def run_interaction_episode(self, agent, environment) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    episode_data = []
    state = environment.reset()

    done = False
    step = 0
    while not done:
        action = agent.select_action(state)
        next_state, reward, done, info = environment.step(action)

        # Compute composite emotional reward (including instinctual and social/emotional cues)
        emotional_reward = self.rl_core.compute_reward(
            state=state,
            emotion_values=info.get('emotional_context'),
            narrative=agent.current_narrative()
        )

        # Store experience in memory for meta-learning
        self.memory.store_experience({
            "state": state,
            "action": action,
            "reward": emotional_reward,
            "next_state": next_state,
            "emotion": info.get('emotional_context'),
            "narrative": agent.current_narrative(),
            "done": done
        })

        # Update RL core based on emotional feedback
        self.rl_core.update(
            state=state,
            action=action,
            reward=emotional_reward,
            next_state=next_state,
            done=done,
            emotion_context=info.get('emotional_context')
        )

        episode_data.append({
            "step": step,
            "emotion": info.get('emotional_context'),
            "reward": emotional_reward
        })
        state = next_state
        step += 1

    return {"episode_data": episode_data}
```

## 5. Using Emotional Rewards for Model Fine-Tuning and Self-Awareness

### Integration of Foundational Models and LoRAs

- **Fine-Tuning:** Use stored emotional rewards and interaction meta-data to fine-tune the foundational language model.
- **LoRA for Image & Video:** Leverage emotional states as cues for generating imagery or video scenarios that reflect the agent’s internal state.
- **Self-Reflection Module:** Implement a module that allows the agent to "self-reflect" by processing its own recorded interactions and emotional responses. This self-reflection is key to developing self-awareness and an internal model of identity.

**Example Integration:**

```python
# python: models/narrative/narrative_engine.py
def generate_self_reflection(self, interaction_log: List[Dict]) -> str:
    """
    Generate a reflective narrative based on past emotional rewards and interactions.
    """
    # Use foundational model fine-tuned with emotional meta-memory to generate narrative
    refined_log = prepare_data(interaction_log)
    narrative = self.foundational_model.generate(
        prompt="Reflect on the following experiences: " + refined_log,
        parameters={"temperature": 0.8, "max_length": 512}
    )
    return narrative
```

## 6. Recommended AI Tools for Unreal Engine Development

To assist developers in building these robust simulations, consider the following AI tools that integrate well with Unreal Engine 5:

- **Unreal Engine’s AI Perception System:** For real-time event and emotion recognition.
- **Live Link Face:** For streaming live capture of facial expressions.
- **Behavior Trees & AI Controllers:** Native to Unreal for developing complex agent behaviors.
- **External AI Copilot Tools:** Tools that assist in real-time debugging and simulation adjustments, such as those integrated with VS Code.

## 7. Conclusion

This guide provides an initial framework for developing simulation scenarios in Unreal Engine that align with the goals of the ACM project. Creating a robust system that evolves from basic survival instincts to complex, self-aware social interactions, driven by emotional reinforcement learning.

Abstract
In this paper, we propose VideoLLaMA3, a more advanced multimodal
foundation model for image and video understanding. The core design
philosophy of VideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of “vision-
centric” is two-fold: the vision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric
framework design. The key insight of our vision-centric training paradigm
is thathigh-quality image-text data is crucial for both image and video
understanding. Instead of preparing massive video-text datasets, we focus
onconstructinglarge-scaleandhigh-qualityimage-textdatasets. VideoL-
LaMA3 has four training stages: 1) vision-centric alignment stage , which
warmsupthevisionencoderandprojector;2) vision-languagepretrain-
ing stage , whichjointly tunesthevision encoder,projector, and LLMwith
large-scale image-text data covering multiple types (including scene im-
ages,documents,charts)aswellastext-onlydata. 3) multi-taskfine-tuning
stage,whichincorporatesimage-textSFTdatafordownstreamtasksand
video-textdatatoestablishafoundationforvideounderstanding. 4) video-
centricfine-tuning , whichfurtherimprovesthemodel’scapabilityinvideo
understanding. As for the framework design, to better capture fine-grained
detailsinimages,thepretrainedvisionencoderisadaptedtoencodeimages
of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding numbers, rather
than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the number
ofvisiontokensaccordingtotheirsimilaritysothattherepresentationof
videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from vision-centric de-
signs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both image and
video understanding benchmarks.

Inherit from VideoLLaMA [ 45] and VideoLLaMA2 [ 46], VideoLLaMA3, a more advanced

numbers or with numbers among several fixed choices, which is an inflexible and unnatural
way to represent images. To alleviate this limitation, we adapt the pretrained vision encoder
to receive images with variable shapes. This is achieved by replacing the fixed positional
embeddings with the Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). We finetune thevision encoder

❶Any-resolution Vision Tokenization (AVT) and❷Differential Frame Pruner (DiffFP) .
When it comes to data, since we propose to improve video understanding capabilities
based on image understanding, we also develop a pipeline for constructing high-quality
re-captioned image dataset.
2.1 Any-resolution Vision Tokenization
In MLLMs, visual inputs are extracted into vision tokens for multimodal understanding.
The common practice [ 47,48] is to extract visual inputs with a pre-trained ViT-based vision
encoder. The pre-trained vision encoder only receives images with fixed resolutions, which
introducesinformationloss. Toalleviateinformationloss,AnyRestechniques[ 28,31,32]are
proposed to split images into patches with fixed resolutions. Although AnyRes techniques

within an image when extracting vision tokens. In VideoLLaMA3, we adopt the idea of
Any-resolution Vision Tokenization (AVT) [ 30,49] to dynamically process images and

architectures) to handle variable resolutions by employing a strategy to replace the absolute
positionembeddingsinViTwith2D-RoPE[ 50]. WithAVT,imagesandvideosofdifferent
resolutions are better represented with more details included in vision tokens. To make
the vision encoder compatible with AVT, we fine-tune the vision encoder and the projector
in the stage of Vision Encoder Adaptation (i.e., stage #1 in Figure 2) using scene images,
document data, and scene images with texts.
2.2 Differential Frame Pruner
Forvideos, inputs whichusuallyhave muchmore tokensthanimage inputsafter tokeniza-
tion, to reduce the computation demand for videos, we apply a per-frame 2 ×2 spatial
downsamplingbybilinearinterpolationtolimitthecontextlengthwithinacertainrange.
Besides,consideringthatvideosconsistofframeswithoverlappingcontent,representing
videosbystackingvisiontokensfromeachframeleadstolengthyandredundanttokens. To
furtherreducethenumberoftokensofvideos,weproposetheDifferentialFramePruner
(DiffFP) to prune the video tokens. Inspired by RLT [ 51], we compare the 1-norm distance
between temporally consecutive patches within the pixel space. We consider temporally
consecutive patches with smaller distances to be redundant, and the later patches can be
pruned. Specifically,asshowninFigure4,wefirstcalculatethe1-normdistancebetween
consecutive frames in the pixel space and then remove patches whose distances fall below a
pre-defined threshold. Following RLT [51], we set the default threshold to 0.1.
2.3 Construction of High-Quality Image Re-Caption Dataset
TotrainourVideoLLaMA3,weconstructedahigh-qualityimagere-captiondataset,VL3-
Syn7M. All images in this dataset are sourced from COYO-700M [52] and processed using
our proposed cleaning pipeline as below:
1)AspectRatioFiltering. Webeginbyfilteringimagesbasedontheiraspectratios,removing
those with extreme values. This step ensures that the dataset contains images with typical
aspect ratios, preventing potential biases during feature extraction. For instance, images

2)AestheticScoreFiltering. Anaestheticscoringmodelisappliedtoevaluatethevisual

3)Text-Image Similarity CalculationwithCoarseCaptioning. TheBLIP2 modelisused
to generate initial captions for images, followed by calculating the text-image similarity

using the CLIP model. Images with low similarity are excluded, as they are likely to contain
contentthatischallengingtodescribeconcisely. Thisprocessensuresthattheremaining
images are both descriptive and interpretable.
4)VisualFeatureClustering. VisualfeaturesareextractedusingtheCLIPvisionmodel,and
ak-Nearest-Neighbors(KNN)algorithmisappliedforclustering. Thismethodidentifies
cluster centers in the visual feature space. From each cluster, we select a fixed number of
images. Thisapproachensuresdiversitywithinthedatasetwhilemaintainingabalanced

5)ImageRe-caption. Afterfilteringandclusteringtheimages,weproceedwithdetailed
re-captioning. Brief captions are generated using InternVL2-8B [ 31,53], while the detailed
captions are produced with InternVL2-26B [ 31,53]. These two types of captions (VL3-
Syn7M-short and VL3-Syn7-detailed) are employed at different stages of training to address
varying needs.
Throughtheaforementionedcleaningandre-captionprocess,wecreatedtheVL3-Syn7M
dataset, which consists of 7 million image-caption pairs. This high-quality dataset will be a
crucial component in training our model, providing a rich and diverse set of images and
annotations that support strong performance across a wide range of visual tasks.
3 Training
As illustrated in Figure 3, VideoLLaMA3 consists of four key components: a vision encoder,
a video compressor, a projector, and a large language model (LLM). The vision encoder
extracts visual tokens and is initialized with the pre-trained SigLIP [ 54]. To reduce the
numberofvisiontokensrepresentingvideos,avideocompressorisemployed. Theprojector
bridges the features between the vision encoder and the LLM. For the LLM, we utilize
Qwen2.5 models [5].
Inspired by previous explorations in MLLMs [ 24,28,30], we develop video understanding
capabilitiesbasedonstrongimageunderstandingfoundations. Toenablethemodelwith
strong image and video understanding capabilities simultaneously, the training of Vide-
oLLaMA3hasfourstages: 1)VisionEncoderAdaptation,2)Vision-LanguageAlignment,
3)MassiveMulti-taskFine-tuning,and4)Video-centricFine-tuning. Whilethefirstthree

This fine-tuning transforms the encoder into a dynamic-resolution processor, enhancing its

2)Vision-LanguageAlignmentStage. Thisstageprimarilyfocusesonintroducingmulti-
modal knowledge into the model. During this phase, all parameters are made trainable,
enabling both the LLM and the vision encoder to befine-tuned for integrating multimodal
knowledge.
3) Multi-task Fine-tuning Stage. In this stage, we perform instruction fine-tuning using a

we filter images from the LAION dataset [ 65] to include those with clear and readable text,
resulting in a collection of 3 million high-quality images, which we term as Laion-OCR
dataset. For the Laion-OCR dataset captions, we include both the text content and the
corresponding bounding box annotations of the text locations. The caption format is as
follows:
{Caption}. The texts in this image are {Text1}<box>[{Bounding Box 1}]</box>,

the model’s ability to handle a variety of document types.
Forchart images,sincecharts sharemanysimilaritieswith documentsintermsofcontent

Chart-to-Text [75] dataset.
For fine-grained images, we construct two types of data: region caption data and grounded
caption data. Region caption data describes the content of specific regions within an im-
age. These data are derived and constructed from the Ospery-724K [ 76], Object365 [ 56],
ADE20K [ 77], and MDVP-Data [ 78] datasets. These data help the model to understand
the details of the image at the region level. Grounded caption data consist of textual de-
scriptionsofobjectswithcorrespondingboundingboxannotations,primarilyconstructed
from the Flickr-30K [79] and GranD [80] datasets. Both types of data enhance the model’s
understanding of images, supporting moreaccurateobject localization andrecognition in

For multi-image scenes, we leverage the Demon-Full [ 92] and Contrastive-Caption [ 93]

captions for the final image in a comic strip, completing missing text in images with oc-

In addition, we further expand the data scale and strengthen the model by synthesizing
dense captions and QAs of specific aspects. Specifically, following the pipeline proposed in
[24], we first filter 68K dynamic videos from Panda-70M [ 112] dataset by optical flow, and
thenemployQwen2-VL-72B[ 30]togeneratediversedensecaptionsandQAsforeachvideo

3.3 Implementation Details
In this part, we briefly introduce the implementation details of each training stage. For
allstages,weadoptthecosinelearningratescheduler. Thewarmupratioofthelearning
rate is set as 0.03. The maximum token length is set as 16384, while the maximum token
length for vision tokens is set as 10240. In the stage of Vision Encoder Adaptation, when
training VideoLLaMA3-2B, we initialize the vision encoder with the pre-trained weights of
SigLIP[54]andtheLLMwiththepre-trainedweightsofQwen2.5-2B[ 5]. ForVideoLLaMA3-
7B, the vision encoder is initialized with the fine-tuned SigLIP weights in VideoLLaMA3-2B

theremainingstages,thelearningratesfortheLLM,theprojector,andthevisionencoder
are set as 1.0×10−5,1.0×10−5,2.0×10−6, respectively. The differential frame pruner is
applied in the multi-task fine-tuning stage and the video-centric fine-tuning stage where
video data is involved. The threshold to discard similar visual tokens is 0.1. To limit context
length, the visual tokens of videos are spatially downsampled after vision encoder by a

To evaluate the image recognition and perception capabilities of VideoLLaMA3, we conduct
assessments on several representative benchmarks commonly used in Image-LLMs. These
benchmarks cover four dimensions: document/chart/scene text understanding, mathemati-
cal reasoning, multi-image understanding, and general knowledge QA.
Document/Chart/Scene Text Understanding. To evaluate VideoLLaMA3’s ability to un-
derstand various forms oftexts in images, including documents, charts, and scene text,we
conduct assessments on a range of benchmarks. Specifically, we use: 1) DocVQA [ 113]
for document understanding, which evaluates the model’s ability to process and extract
information from text in documents; 2) ChartQA [ 42] and InfoVQA [ 113] for chart un-

Multi-image Understanding. To assess VideoLLaMA3’s ability to understand and reason
about multiple images in conjunction, we evaluate the model on several widely used bench-
marks, includingMMMU-Pro [ 117], MMMU[ 118], andBLINK [ 119]. These benchmarks
test the model’s ability to draw connections between images, handle multiple visual inputs.
GeneralKnowledgeQA. Finally,toevaluateVideoLLaMA3’sperformanceingeneralques-
tion answering, particularly in real-world and complex scenarios, we conduct assessments
using several challenging benchmarks. The benchmarks include: 1) RealWorldQA [ 120],
which focuses on answering questions based on realistic images drawn from everyday sce-
narios, 2) AI2D [ 121], which evaluates the model’s ability to reason about diagrams and
scienceimages,3)GQA[ 122],whichassessesgeneralquestionansweringwithafocuson

4.2 Video-based Evaluation
4.2.1 Baselines
To comprehensively evaluate the video performance of VideoLLaMA3, we compare it with
a diverse set of baseline models. Similar to image evaluation, there are few available models
witha2Bparametersizeinthecommunity. Weselectseveralstrongbaselines, including
Apollo-2B [ 14], InternVL2.5-2B [ 32], and Qwen2VL-2B [ 30]. For the 7B model, we compare
it with general models such as Qwen2VL-8B [ 30], InternVL2.5-8B [ 32], and NVILA [ 36],
as well as proprietary models like LLaVA-Video [ 24], Apollo-7B [ 14], and our previous
generation model, VideoLLaMA2 [46].
4.2.2 Benchmarks
The video understanding capabilities of VideoLLaMA3 are systematically evaluated across
threecoredimensions: generalunderstanding,temporalreasoning,andlong-formvideo
comprehension.
General Video Understanding. We assess VideoLLaMA3’s general video understanding
capabilities through established benchmarks: (1) Multi-Choice Video Question Answer-
ing(MC-VQA)tasks,includingMVBench[ 26],VideoMME[ 126],EgoSchema[ 127],and
Perception-Test [ 128]. (2) Open-Ended Video Question Answering (OE-VQA) tasks, includ-
ing ActivityNet-QA [ 129] and VCGBench [ 25]. This evaluation suite follows the protocol of
VideoLLaMA2 [ 46]. We also run evaluations on MMVU [ 130] which includes both the task
types mentioned above.
Long Video Understanding. To further examine the capacity of VideoLLaMA3 to process
and comprehend long-form video content, we assess performance on three long-video
15
understanding (LVU) benchmarks: (1) MLVU [ 131]: diverse long-video understanding
tasksforvideosrangingfrom3minutestomorethan2hours, (2)LongVideoBench[ 132]:
videoreasoningoverthereferredcontextwithinlongvideo-languageinterleavedinputs,
and (3) LVBench [133]: extreme long video understanding.
Video Temporal Reasoning. To assess the temporal awareness and reasoning capabilities
of VideoLLaMA3, we conduct evaluations on the following tasks: (1) Temporal Perception
and Reasoning tasks, including TempCompass [ 134] and NextQA [ 135]; and (2) Temporal
SentenceGroundingtaskonCharades-STA[ 108]benchmark,withmeanIntersectionover
Union (mIoU) metric.
4.2.3 Evaluation Protocols

model response are extracted by regular expression, and then treated as one or multiple
time intervals. Based on this strategy, we finally report the mIoU bewteen the ground-truth
intervals and the predicted intervals.

the words in the document image, demonstrating the strong performance of VideoLLaMA3
in understanding dense information in images.
Multi-Image Understanding. Figure 8 gives three examples on multi-image understanding
tasks. In the first example, VideoLLaMA3 can tell the differences between two types of
birds. The second example demonstrates that VideoLLaMA3 is able to locate answers from
long documents (even with multiple images) rather than simplying parsing words. It is an

Question : What do you think of 
this stock? Is it worth holding? 
Why?VideoLLaMA  3: The stock  shown  in this chart  appears  to be 
a volatile  and potentially  risky  investment . The price  has been  
fluctuating  significantly,  with sharp  peaks  and drops . This kind of 
volatility  can be indicative  of a stock  that is not stable  or reliable . 
While  the MACD  indicator  shows  some  positive  momentum , 
suggesting  potential  for future  growth,  the overall  pattern  of the 
stock  price  is concerning . The large  red candlesticks  at the bottom  
of the chart  indicate  significant  selling  pressure,  which  could  be a 
sign of investor  uncertainty  or negative  news  affecting  the stock . 
Without  more  context  about  the company's  fundamentals,  industry  
trends,  or market  conditions,  it's difficult  to make  a definitive  
recommendation . However,  based  solely  on the price  action  shown  
in this chart,  I would  advise  caution . The stock  seems  to be 
experiencing  high volatility,  which  increases  risk for investors . If 
you're  considering  holding  this stock,  l'd suggest  doing  thorough  
research  and possibly  diversifying  your portfolio  to mitigate  risk. It 
might  be better  to wait for more  stable  price  action  or consider  
alternative  investments  that appear  less volatile .
Question : Which model do you think is the strongest? Why?
VideoLLaMA  3: The strongest  model  in the graph  is Qwen 2-VL-7B, as it has the highest  average  
performance  and the most  activated  parameters . This suggests  that it has a more  powerful  architecture  and is 
better  at processing  visual  information .
Question : Which model do you think is the optimal? Why?
VideoLLaMA  3: The optimal  model  in the graph  is DeepSeek -VL2, as it has a good  balance  between  
average  performance  and activated  parameters . It performs  well without  being  overly  complex,  making  it a good  
choice  for applications  that require  high  performance  but also need  to be efficient .

Question : What is this 
image designed for? 
What do you think are 
the shortcomings of 
the design of this 
poster? How can it be 
improved?VideoLLaMA  3: This image  appears  to be designed  as a poster  for a 
Fall Festival  planning  meeting . The main  text “Planning Meeting”  is 
prominently  displayed,  followed  by “FallFestival”  in a larger,  more  decorative  
font.The design  hassome  shortcomings :1. Lack  of visual  hierarchy : The text
doesn‘t  clearly  differentiate  between  the meeting  and the festival .2. 
Insufficient  information : It doesn’t  provide details  about  the date,  time,  
location,  or purpose  of themeeting .3. Limited  color  palette : The use of green  
andorange  leaves  on a white  background  might  not be very eye-catching  or 
memorable .To improve  this design :1.Add a clear  visual  hierarchy  by using  
different  font sizes and styles  for “Planning  Meeting”  and “Fall  Festival .”2.
Include  essential  details  like date,  time,  and location below  the main  text.3. 
Use a more  vibrant  color  scheme that stands  out, perhaps  incorporating  autumn  
colors like reds,  yellows,  and oranges .4. Consider  adding  asmall  icon or

VideoLLaMA  3: Here  is the text from  the document : Whilst  
the problem  of wear  is present,  the results  are still excellent  when  
compared  with the results  from metal -on-metal  given  above . When  
dealing  with patients,  a modification  to something  that is very 
successful  would  appear  to be a safer  and more  appropriate  solution . 
Problem :- Femoral  Heads
A major  problem  is in vivo damage  to metal  femoral  heads . (Isaac  et 
al, 1992 ; Jasty  et al, 1994 ). Relatively  small  amounts  of damage  can 
produce  dramatic  effects :
".... a single  transverse  scratch  can increase  the wear  rate of the 
polyethylene  to a remarkable  extent .”
Dowson  et al (1987 )
However,  ceramic  femoral  heads  have  been  shown  to behave  in 
significantly  different  ways :
"A ceramic  femoral  head  is not only less prone  to damage  by 
particles  of bone  cement  in three  body  wear  processes,  but any 
damage  produced  is less likely  to cause  increased  wear  rates  of 
UHMWPE  acetabular  cups.”
Cooper  et al (1991 )
This has been  shown  to have  significant  effects  on clinical  wear  rates :
Wear  rate, metal  head :- 0.10mm per year
Wear  rate, ceramic  head :- 0.03mm per year
Schuller  and Marti  (1990 )
It has also been  shown  that the new generation  of Zirconia  ceramics  
perform  significantly  better  as a bearing  surface  than the current  
generation  of Alumina  ceramics  offering  a further  45% reduction  in 
polyethylene  wear  (Kumar  et al, 1991 )
It has further  been  shown  that femoral  head -size affects  volumetric  
wear  rates…

Question : What part of a 
basketball game is this?VideoLLaMA  3: This appears  to be a free throw  situation  in a 
basketball  game . The player  wearing  number  23 is standing  at the free 
throw  line, which  is typically  located  15 feet from  the basket . He's 
holding  the ball and preparing  to take a shot,  with his arms  raised  above  
his head  in the classic  free throw  stance . The presence  of other  players  on 
the court,  including  those  wearing  green  jerseys,  suggests  this is during  
an actual  game  rather  than a practice  session . The crowd  visible  in the 
background  further  supports  that this is taking  place  during  an official
match . Free throws  are a crucial  part of basketball,  often  occurring  after 
fouls  or technical  violations . This moment  captures  the tension  and focus  
as the player  attempts  to score  points  for his team .

influential  paintings  in the history  of art. It represents  a pinnacle  
of Renaissance  art, characterized  by its lifelike  representation,  
subtle  use of light and shadow,  and the enigmatic  smile  of the 
subject . The painting's  historical  impact  lies in its technical  
mastery  and its enduring  mystery , which  has captivated  viewers  
for centuries . The Mona  Lisa has been  a subject  of fascination,  
inspiring  countless  imitations,  parodies,  and references  in 
popular  culture . Its significance  extends  beyond  its artistic  value ; 
it symbolizes  the Renaissance’s  humanistic  ideals  and the 
pursuit  of knowledge  and beauty . The painting's  fame  has also 
contributed  to the establishment  of museums  as cultural  
institutions,  with the Louvre  Museum  in Paris  being  one of the 
world’s  most  visited  due in part to the Mona  Lisa.

Subsequentmodelsproposevariousmethodstoovercometokenlimitationsandsupport
long-formvideounderstanding. Forexample,some[ 13]directlyextendthecontextwindow
of LLMs, while others [ 24,142–149] introduce video token compression techniques that
perform pooling across spatial, temporal, or both dimensions. While most approaches
utilizeimage-basedencoders[ 14–18,27],someincorporatevideo-specificencoderstobetter
capture temporal dependencies [19–22].
Morerecentworks[ 22,23,150–157]extendbeyondvisualinputsbyincorporatingaudio,
usingseparateencodersforeachmodalityandintegratingthemthroughanLLMdecoder.
These models leverage joint instruction tuning on video-audio datasets [ 158–160] to cap-
tureinteractionsbetweenvisualandauditoryinformation. Additionally,recentadvances
in streaming video understanding focus on real-time processing [ 161–165], employing
techniqueslikeadaptivememoryandincrementalprocessingfortaskssuchasliveevent
detection and real-time captioning. Previous works [ 14,19,22,24,142,149] typically follow
a training recipe that involves an alignment phase, followed by supervised fine-tuning, with
instruction-tuning datasets [ 18,24–27] often being video dominant. However, we propose a
vision-centrictraining paradigmto enhancevideounderstanding capabilitiesby focusing
on large-scale image understanding pre-training. This approach leverages high-quality
image-text datasets to build robust vision encoders that are then adapted for video tasks.
Multimodal LLMs for General Vision Understanding. Recently, a growing number of
generalMLLMshavebeendevelopedtoprocessbothimagesandvideos. While,inprinciple,
models designed to handle multiple images are inherently capable of processing video data,
achieving optimal performance requires dedicated training on video-specific datasets.
Previousstudies[ 28,29,93,166]havedemonstratedthatgeneralMLLMswithrobustimage

tasks, even with minimal or no dedicated video training data. These findings highlight the
effectivenessoftasktransferfromimagestovideos,showcasingthemodels’strongvideo

Furthermore,Qwen2-VL[ 30]adoptsaunifiedframeworkforprocessingbothimagesand

InternVL-2[ 31],andInternVL-2.5[ 32],whichscalebothmodelsizes(rangingfrom1billion
to 78 billion parameters) and the volume of training data, have achieved highly competitive
performance in both image and video understanding tasks. To address the challenges of
processing longer video inputs, recent studies [ 33,34] have proposed solutions such as
adapting model architectures by incorporating a hybrid design of Mamba and Transformer
blocks or training with extensive long video datasets to support extended input and output
sequences.
Recentstudies[ 4,167,168]haveintegratedtext,image,andvideomodalitieswithaudioand
speech modalities to improve models’ video understanding and cross-scenario performance.

6 Discussion, Limitations, and Future Work
6.1 Discussion
TheintroductionofVideoLLaMA3marksasignificantadvancementintherealmofMLLMs,
particularly in bridging the gap between image and video understanding. By adopting a
vision-centric training paradigm, VideoLLaMA3 leverages the robustness of image-centric
data to enhance video comprehension, effectively mitigating the challenge associated with
temporal dynamics and the complexity of video data. This approach underscores the
inferent value of high-quality image-text datasets, which are more readily available and
easier to curate compared to their video-text counterparts. The success of VideoLLaMA3 on
diversebenchmarks,includingVideoMME,PerceptionTest,MLVU,DocVQA,andMathVista,
demonstrates its versatility and efficacy across various multimodal tasks.
24
The model’s ability to maintain strong performance in both image and video domains
highlightstheeffectivenessofourvision-centricframeworkdesigns. Specifically,thedynamic
resolution adaptation and vision token compression strategies facilitate a more flexible and
efficientrepresentationofvisualinputs,enablingthemodeltohandleawiderangeofimage
andvideoformatswithminimalinformationloss. Thisflexibilityiscrucialforreal-world
applications where visual data can vary significantly in resolution and aspect ratio.
Furthermore,themulti-taskfine-tuningstageofourtrainingparadigmcontributestothe
model’s robust generalization capabilities. By exposing VideoLLaMA3 to a variety of down-
stream tasks, including interactive question answering and video captioning, the model
develops a comprehensive understanding of both static and dynamic visual information.
ThiscomprehensivetrainingenablesVideoLLaMA3toexcelnotonlyinstandardbenchmarks
but also in specialized tasks that require nuanced comprehension of visual content.
6.2 Limitations
Despite the impressive performance of VideoLLaMA3, several limitations must be acknowl-
edged.
Video Data Quality and Diversity. While leveraging large-scale image-text datasets has
proven beneficial, the quality and diversity of video-text datasets remain a constraint. Video
data often suffer from lower annotation quality and limited diversity, which can impede the
model’s ability to generalize across different video domains and genres.
Real-timeProcessing. Thecurrentmodelarchitecturemaynotbeoptimizedforreal-time
video processing tasks, which is essential for applications such as autonomous driving and
livevideoanalytics. Thecomputationaloverheadassociatedwithprocessinghigh-resolution
and lengthy video inputs can hinder real-time performance.
Generalization to Unseen Modalities. While VideoLLaMA3 excels in image and video
understanding, its capability to generalize to other modalities, such as audio or speech data,
remainsunexplored. Integratingadditionalmodalitiescouldfurtherenhancethemodel’s
multimodal comprehension but poses significant challenges in terms of architecture and
training.
6.3 Future Work
Building on the foundations laid by VideoLLaMA3, several avenues for future research are
proposed to address the identified limitations and further enhance the model’s capabilities.
Enhanced Video-Text Datasets. Investing in the creation and curation of higher quality
and more diverse video-text datasets will be crucial. Incorporating annotations that capture
nuancedtemporalandcontextualinformationcansignificantlyimprovethemodel’stemporal
understanding and generalization across different video domains.
Real-time Inference Optimization. Optimizing the model architecture for real-time in-
ference by reducinglatency andimproving processingspeed isessentialforapplications
requiring immediate responses. Techniques such as model acceleration, parallel processing,
and efficient tokenization strategies can contribute to achieving real-time performance.
Multimodal Expansion. Extending VideoLLaMA3 to incorporate additional modalities
like audio, speech, and sensor data can create a more holistic understanding of multimodal
inputs. Researchintounifiedarchitecturesthatseamlesslyintegratemultipledatatypeswill
be pivotal in achieving comprehensive multimodal intelligence.
Advanced Post-Training Techniques. Implementing more sophisticated post-training
methodologies,suchasscalingRLtechniquesforMLLMs,canfurtherrefineVideoLLaMA3’s
performance. RLHF and other RL-based approaches can be employed to better align the
model’s outputs with human preferences and task-specific requirements. Scaling these RL
techniquestoaccommodatethecomplexitiesofmultimodaldatawillenhancethemodel’s
ability to generate more accurate, contextually appropriate, and user-aligned responses,
thereby advancing its overall multimodal intelligence.

Insummary,whileVideoLLaMA3representsasignificantstepforwardinmultimodalAI,
addressing its current limitations through targeted research and development will pave the
way for even more powerful and versatile models in the future.

# Simulation Guide for Building ACM Training Scenarios on Unreal Engine 5

This guide outlines the approach for setting up simulation scenarios in Unreal Engine that are specifically designed to train the Artificial Consciousness Module (ACM) using emotional reinforcement learning. The ACM project is based on principles observed in organic consciousness development in mammals. A stratified accumulation of ancestral experiences, captured as emotional and instinctive responses.

---

## 1. Overview

### Organic Consciousness Principles

- **Stratified Experiences:** Consciousness in mammals evolves from layered, inherited experiences. Our ACM emulates this by accumulating emotional rewards from interactions in simulations. Each interaction represents a building block of ancestral memory.
- **Instinct & Emotional Response:** The agent’s behavior evolves through basic instinctive responses at early simulation stages, eventually developing into complex social behaviors (e.g., love, sadness, self-awareness).

### Goal

- **Incremental Complexity:** Begin with simple survival or interaction scenarios and gradually increase the complexity to include social interactions, communication, and self-reflection.
- **Meta-Memory Storage:** Emotional rewards are treated as meta-memory that not only guide the reinforcement learning process but also serve as feedback to fine-tune foundational models (and act as LoRAs for image/video generation) during simulated reflective thinking.

---

## 2. Setting Up the Unreal Engine Environment

### Environment Configuration

- **Install Unreal Engine 5:** Follow the official installation guide for Unreal Engine 5.
- **Project Setup:** Create a new VR or simulation project. Organize your project structure with folders for maps, assets, and blueprints.
- **AI Tools Integration:**
  - **Behavior Trees and AI Controllers:** Utilize Unreal's Behavior Trees for decision making and AI Controllers to manage agents.
  - **Dynamic Event Systems:** Set up event triggers (using Blueprints or C++ code) that capture simulation events (e.g., danger, social encounters).
  - **Integration Plugins:** Look for plugins that support face recognition, emotion detection, or real-time analytics, such as:
    - **FaceFX** – for facial animation and emotion mapping.
    - **Live Link Face** – to stream facial capture data into Unreal.
    - **AI-Assisted Tools:** Consider third-party AI copilot tools that integrate within Unreal Editor to assist in simulation development.

---

## 3. Simulation Scenarios Development

### Stage 1: Simple Interactions

- **Basic Survival:** Create scenarios where an agent navigates an environment with basic challenges (obstacles, limited resources).
- **Instinctive Responses:** Trigger simple emotional cues (fear, hunger) which will produce initial emotional rewards.
- **Code Example:**

  ```python
  # python: simulations/enviroments/simple_survival.py
  def step(self, action: Dict) -> tuple:
      # Basic environment step
      next_state, reward, done, info = super().step(action)
      # Capture basic instinctual reaction
      info['emotional_context'] = simple_emotion_calculation(next_state)
      return next_state, reward, done, info
  ```

### Stage 2: Advanced Social Interactions

- **Complex Scenarios:** Develop environments where multiple agents interact. Introduce social cues such as cooperation, competition, expressions of empathy (love, sadness).
- **Emotional Feedback Loop:** Integrate face recognition/emotion detection using Unreal plugins:
  - Capture facial expressions.
  - Map expressions to emotional states.
- **Code Example with Unreal Integration:**

  ```python
  # python: simulations/enviroments/advanced_social.py
  def step(self, action: Dict) -> tuple:
      next_state, reward, done, info = super().step(action)
      # Obtain real-time facial emotion from Unreal's face recognition plugin
      if self.face_recognition:
          facial_emotion = self.face_recognition.detect_emotion()
          info['facial_emotion'] = facial_emotion
      # Update contextual emotional state
      info['emotional_context'] = compute_emotion(next_state, facial_emotion)
      return next_state, reward, done, info
  ```

---

## 4. Reinforcement Learning Loop with Emotional Rewards

### Simulation Manager Responsibilities

- **Interaction Episodes:** Manage episodes where the agent interacts with the environment.
- **Reward Shaping:** Combine environmental rewards with emotional signals to calculate a composite emotional reward.
- **Memory and Meta-Memory:** Store each interaction’s emotional reward as meta-memory guiding both present behavior and future fine-tuning of models.

### Sample Interaction Loop:

```python
# python: simulations/api/simulation_manager.py
def run_interaction_episode(self, agent, environment) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    episode_data = []
    state = environment.reset()

    done = False
    step = 0
    while not done:
        action = agent.select_action(state)
        next_state, reward, done, info = environment.step(action)

        # Compute composite emotional reward (including instinctual and social/emotional cues)
        emotional_reward = self.rl_core.compute_reward(
            state=state,
            emotion_values=info.get('emotional_context'),
            narrative=agent.current_narrative()
        )

        # Store experience in memory for meta-learning
        self.memory.store_experience({
            "state": state,
            "action": action,
            "reward": emotional_reward,
            "next_state": next_state,
            "emotion": info.get('emotional_context'),
            "narrative": agent.current_narrative(),
            "done": done
        })

        # Update RL core based on emotional feedback
        self.rl_core.update(
            state=state,
            action=action,
            reward=emotional_reward,
            next_state=next_state,
            done=done,
            emotion_context=info.get('emotional_context')
        )

        episode_data.append({
            "step": step,
            "emotion": info.get('emotional_context'),
            "reward": emotional_reward
        })
        state = next_state
        step += 1

    return {"episode_data": episode_data}
```

## 5. Using Emotional Rewards for Model Fine-Tuning and Self-Awareness

### Integration of Foundational Models and LoRAs

- **Fine-Tuning:** Use stored emotional rewards and interaction meta-data to fine-tune the foundational language model.
- **LoRA for Image & Video:** Leverage emotional states as cues for generating imagery or video scenarios that reflect the agent’s internal state.
- **Self-Reflection Module:** Implement a module that allows the agent to "self-reflect" by processing its own recorded interactions and emotional responses. This self-reflection is key to developing self-awareness and an internal model of identity.

**Example Integration:**

```python
# python: models/narrative/narrative_engine.py
def generate_self_reflection(self, interaction_log: List[Dict]) -> str:
    """
    Generate a reflective narrative based on past emotional rewards and interactions.
    """
    # Use foundational model fine-tuned with emotional meta-memory to generate narrative
    refined_log = prepare_data(interaction_log)
    narrative = self.foundational_model.generate(
        prompt="Reflect on the following experiences: " + refined_log,
        parameters={"temperature": 0.8, "max_length": 512}
    )
    return narrative
```

## 6. Recommended AI Tools for Unreal Engine Development

To assist developers in building these robust simulations, consider the following AI tools that integrate well with Unreal Engine 5:

- **Unreal Engine’s AI Perception System:** For real-time event and emotion recognition.
- **Live Link Face:** For streaming live capture of facial expressions.
- **Behavior Trees & AI Controllers:** Native to Unreal for developing complex agent behaviors.
- **External AI Copilot Tools:** Tools that assist in real-time debugging and simulation adjustments, such as those integrated with VS Code.

## 7. Conclusion

This guide provides an initial framework for developing simulation scenarios in Unreal Engine that align with the goals of the ACM project. Creating a robust system that evolves from basic survival instincts to complex, self-aware social interactions, driven by emotional reinforcement learning.

 Using modular neural networks to 
model self-consciousness and self-
representation for artificial entities 
 
 
 
Milton Martínez Luaces , Celina Gayoso,  Juan P azos Sierra and Alfonso Rodríguez-Patón.  
 
 
 
Abstract-  Self-consciousness implies not only self or 
group recognition, but also real knowledge of one’s own identity. 
Self-consciousness is only possible if  an individual is intelligent 
enough to formulate an abstract self-representation. Moreover, it 
necessarily entails the capability of  referencing and using this self-
representation in connection with other cognitive features, such as 
inference, and the anticipation of  the consequences of both one’s 
own and other individuals’ acts.  
In this paper, a cognitive architecture for self-
consciousness is proposed. This cognitive architecture includes 
several modules: abstraction, sel f-representation, other individuals' 
representation, decision and acti on modules. It includes a learning 
process of self-representation by direct (self-experience based) and 
observational learning (based on the observation of other 
individuals). For model implemen tation a new approach is taken 
using Modular Artificial Neural Networks (MANN). For model testing, a virtual environment has been implemented. This virtual 
environment can be described as a holonic system or holarchy, 
meaning that it is composed of  autonomous entities that behave 
both as a whole and as part of a greater whole. The system is composed of a certain number of holons interacting. These holons  
are equipped with cognitive features , such as sensory perception, 
and a simplified model of personalit y and self-representation. We 
explain holons’ cognitive architecture that enables dynamic self-representation. We analyse the effect of holon interaction, focusing 
on the evolution of the holon’s abst ract self-representation. Finally, 
the results are explained and analysed and conclusions drawn.  
 
Keywords-  holons,  modular neural networks, self-
conciousness, self-representation. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
Understanding consciousness has been defined as "the 
ultimate intellectual challenge of this new millennium" [10]. 
Since ancient cultures, consciousness has been discussed by 
philosophers, jurists and religious leaders. The word 
“consciousness” comes from Latin conscientia , a word used 
in juridical Roman documents by writers like Cicero [33]. 
Literally, conscientia  means “knowledge (science) with”, 
that is, shared knowledge. Historically, it was first used to refer to moral conscience, as in  Christian Codices [24]. From 
the very beginning conscientia  was associated with 
responsibility (moral or legal) . Now, conciousness constitutes  the basis of modern legal guilt-penalty systems 
[31]. In this sense, consciousness is a kind of self-awareness; it is a condition for cognition.  More recently, consciousness has been focused by 
modern disciplines such as  Psychology, Neuroscience and 
Artificial Intelligence (AI). Especially in AI, an important 
aim is the definition an later implementation of a model for consciousness. In this line of work, the first step is finding 
an answer to the main question: “Where does consciousness 
reside?” Is it immaterial, like “the soul”, or is there a 
physical support - a neural correlate - for consciousness? 
[29]. A neural correlate of co nsciousness (NCC, according to 
[6]) are "neural systems and properties of that systems, 
which are associated with co nscious mental states" [14]. 
Another definition of a NCC,  which may perhaps be commonly accepted, is “a neural  correlate of consciousness 
is a neural system (S) plus a certain state of this system (NS), which together are correla ted with a certain state of 
consciousness (C) [10]. The ex istence of a NCC is widely 
accepted in scientific commun ity, but unfortunately "how 
these neural correlates actually produce consciousness, is left 
untouched" [14]. This is not surprising, because the study of 
consciousness is not an easy task, taking into account the 
"complexity of the neuronal ar chitectures involved, it seems 
risky to draw conclusions simply on the basis of intuitive 
reasoning" [10]. Due to this complexity, Francis Crick opted 
to defer even a consciousness definition to avoid precipitation [8]. 
 Consciousness can be divided in two important 
categories. The first category is similar to self-knowledge, 
which has to do with the ordinary notion of being conscious. 
Many people think that this kind of consciousness is the same as knowledge. Actually, though, it is a way of 
developing declarative memories. Declarative memories are 
memories that can be recalled and told to others. The second category, called “qualia”, refers to the idea that the feelings 
associated with a sensation are independent of the sensory 
input. As this is a more metaphysical category than the first 
one, it will not be considered in this paper. Qualia are 
frequently formulated in questions like, “Why is the colour 
red, red?” “Does the colour red appear to be th e same colour 
to you?” Rita Levi Montalcini, the Nobel Laureate for 
Medicine, pointed out that the three main lines of research 
into the consciousness problem were: the neurosciences, 
cognitive science and AI. This paper is concerned with the 
two last lines, and especially cognitive science.  
 Another important point that is present in the approach we use in this paper is that consciousness research 
must focus on both cognitive processes and beahaviour. The 
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION
Issue 2, Volume 2, 2008
163     Manuscript received December 7, 2007; Revised June 2, 2008 essential idea in AI, proposed by Turing in his test (as a 
measure) and his machine (as a medium), can be established 
as follows: “The brain is just another kind of computer. It doesn’t matter how you design an artificially intelligent 
system, it just has to produce human like behaviour”. 
Nevertheless, this behaviourism is the main problem in the classic AI field. The Turing test, which takes intelligence 
and human behaviour to be equivalent, limits the vision of 
what is possible: from a connectionist or a symbolist point of view, it focuses on behaviour and ignores other relevant 
aspects. In fact, one can be intelligent by thinking and 
understanding without acting. Ignoring what happens in the brain and focusing only on behaviour has been and is the 
greatest obstacle to understanding intelligence. 
Of course, such profound questions are quite 
difficult to answer because our knowledge of the human 
brain and cognitive processes is still poor. Despite the 
limitations we have in this field, some psychologists have made considerable advances by observing cognitive features 
in connection with human – and sometimes animal – 
behaviour. In this paper we intend to analyse cognitive 
features and their relation to the learning process and 
behaviour. From a cognitive science viewpoint, we base our 
research on an analytical approach to consciousness, 
focusing on the self-consciousness feature. We propose a cognitive architecture for self-consciousness  using Modular 
Artificial Neural Networks (MANN). We implemented a 
virtual environment with intelligent virtual holons to test the 
proposed model. Finally, we an alyse the results are and draw 
some conclusions 
   
II. CONSCIOUSNESS FEATURES 
 
Because it is impossible to understand consciousness as a 
whole, the most common approach - as is usual in science - 
is analytical. This means that consciousness is defined injectively, that is, based on the features habitually 
associated with consciousne ss or the features in which 
consciousness is believed to pl ay a role. Bernard Baars [5]  
and Igor Alexander [1] have suggested several cognitive features of consciousness beings. From these and other 
researchers, we can extract several cognitive features that 
must be present in the consciousness phenomenon. These 
features can be divided into three abstraction levels: basic, intermediate and advanced features.  
As we consider consciousne ss as a holonic system, each 
feature can be viewed as a whole and, at the same time, as a 
part of the holonic system. View ed individually, as a whole, 
these features are not basic at all. However, viewed as parts 
of consciousness, they can be described as the building blocks of consciousness. This level encompasses reactivity , 
adaptability , associative memory , learning  ability and 
optimisation . A lot of successful research has been done into 
modelling and implementing these features. 
Intermediate features are the result of a composition or 
interaction of basic features  (level 1). They include 
abstraction, prediction, anticipation, generalization, 
inference, emotion, motivation and imagination. Some 
research has been done focusi ng on these features with 
patchy results. 
Consciousness also include a dvanced features. These are 
complex and require a cognitive architecture composed of features from levels 1 and 2. They include free will, moral judgement and self-consciousness.  As we have already 
mentioned, these features are the hardest to model and to 
find a suitable technology for implementation. In this paper, 
we focus especially in self-consciousness. 
 
 
 
III.  A NEURAL CORRELATE OF SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS 
 
It is sometimes said that consciousness does not have its 
own neural correlate, but it is ju st the sum of all the features 
listed above [5]. Contrary to this, other researchers postulate 
that consciousness is not merely a sum of cognitive features. 
They claim that, once all these features are present in an 
individual, they interact with each other, generating new 
features at a higher abstraction level. As a result of this 
emerging behaviour , “the whole is greater than the sum of 
the parts” [19]. The fact is, in any case, that consciousness is 
always associated with these features. Therefore, a lot of 
research work has been done proposing models for each 
consciousness-related f eature and also possible 
implementations in the field of artificial intelligence and 
cognitive science have been essayed [16] [17] [38] [39]. As 
we have already said, in this paper, we focus on the last feature listed above: self-consciousness   
There are different ideas, and consequently different 
definitions, of self-conscious ness. Some researchers [22] 
[27] make a distinction between self-awareness  (knowledge 
of oneself as an entity) and self-consciousness . Self-
consciousness has been defined as “the possession of a concept of identity, as well as the ability to use this concept 
to think about oneself” [26].  In some animal species, we can 
observe earlier states on the path towards self-consciousness . 
Most mammals and birds can recognize other individuals of 
their species as being similar. This means they have a sense 
of belonging in terms of their species [40]. A few superior mammals not only have a sense of self-belonging , but also 
demonstrate self-awareness . Self-awareness means they can 
distinguish their own image from that of other individuals, which is one of the signs that confirms they have this 
cognitive feature. This select group now lists chimpanzees 
[42], dolphins [35], a recent addition, elephants [34], and of 
course, human beings. 
In the artificial intelligence fi eld, several researchers are 
working on the implementation of self-awareness  and self-
consciousness  in robots [25] or even in software holons or 
soft-bots [15]. Most are focusing on self-image recognition, 
and robots were recently equipp ed with this feature. It is 
noteworthy, however, that a lthough recognition of one’s 
own image implies self-belonging  or even what has been 
called self-body awareness  [30], this does not necessarily 
prove that the entity (natural or artificial) has self-
consciousness . To be able to say this, the entity would also 
have to be able to build an abstract self-representation  and 
also be able to use it as essential information for properly interacting with other individuals and with the environment [27] [37] [9].  
There is no doubt that self-representation  is a key 
component for self-consciousness , because “how can anyone 
have knowledge of you that you cannot represent?” [22]. 
Conscious individuals have internal representations of 
things, but self-representation  is different from this “primary 
representations”. It has been considered as a case of “secondary representation”, which are "cognitions that 
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION
Issue 2, Volume 2, 2008
164 represent past, future, pretended, or purely hypothetical 
situations in prepositional form" [4]. It is evident that self-
representation must be a secondary one, because it is "a 
constructed mental model of oneself that can be manipulated in fantasy" [4] This cognitive structures are closely related 
with perspective-taking be cause “self-recognition and 
spontaneous perspective-taking develop in close synchrony 
because both require a capacity for secondary 
representation" [4]. 
This self-representation  must necessarily be abstract to 
support abstract inference pro cesses. It also needs to be 
dynamic and flexible enough to adapt to both changes to its own self and changes in the environment. Obviously, this 
would be impossible with a static self-representation. 
Contrariwise, an individual need s to learn about itself - like 
humans do –, and its self-representation  would undergo 
changes induced by a learning process throughout the 
individual’s whole lifetime. In this process, individuals interaction has a great influen ce. The poet Arthur Rimbaud 
said  ''I is some one Else'' (''Je est quelqu_un d_autre''), suggesting that we conceive ou rselves through the eyes of 
others" [36]. Indeed, other individuals influence our self-representation because we not  only build a secondary 
representation of the self, but al so of the others. This other 
individuals representations are also a case of secondary representation because "it is not a perception of a situation but rather a constructed mental image of another person's 
perception of this situation" [4].  
By this interaction, the individual construct relations with 
other individuals, and as a result "each individual has an overall repertoire of selves, each of which stems from a 
relationship with a significant other", This becomes "a source of, the interpersonal pa tterns that characterize the 
individual. Each self is keyed to a mental representation of a significant other" [3]. This source of information becomes a sort "narrative center [...] of all subjective experiences and 
memories in a given individual" [11]. Taking this facts into 
account, we consider that firs t of all, a self-conciousness 
model must include both self and other individual 
representations and the close relation between these 
cognitive features must be also defined. On the other hand, because of the importance of i ndividual interaction in self 
building process, we considered that a simulator that includes interaction between modelled systems would be an 
adequate testing strategy for self-consciousness  models.  
Another important and essential feature is to be able to 
reference this abstract information and apply it in connection with other cognitive features. One such feature is self-
imagination . Self-imagination implies the ability to “see” 
one’s own representation, a cert ain conception of what one is 
like. Another is self-inference , meaning the ability to infer 
information and reason inductively and deductively about 
oneself. Finally, anticipation  is another related feature. 
Anticipation is the ability to foresee results taking into account knowledge about oneself. 
Clearly, self-consciousness  is a complex cognitive 
feature. It includes an abstract and dynamic self-
representation , a mechanism for using this representation 
and interaction with other cognitiv e features to evaluate this 
representation for inference and anticipation. This suggests a 
modular cognitive architecture.  Taking these points into 
account, we chose ANN to provide a neural correlate of self-
consciousness in intelligent individuals. Information cannot be addressed without taking into 
account both natural and artific ial information processing 
devices, because information is an abstraction that is only 
materialised when it has a physical representation. In 
particular, self-information has a representation, which, in 
this paper, is called self-representation. This makes it possible to use and process this information. Cognitive 
capabilities like self-consciousness and abstraction can be 
implemented to provide devices with intelligent behaviour, which is the goal of Artificial Intelligence. In this paper, 
self-consciousness, and abstracti on, or the ability to separate 
the essential from the secondary, are built into the holons. 
Abstraction is necessary for recognizing other individuals, because these representations ar e an abstraction of reality, 
which is useful for each holon’s behaviour [2] [13] [32]. 
The term informon is used in this paper to designate the 
basic component of information.  Indeed, an informon is an 
information entity. Information can take the form of data, 
news or knowledge. Information is produced when some 
degree of uncertainty exists. As Sanders [41] suggested, 
information is produced as a result of an uncertainty 
reduction process. Denning [12] defines information as the 
meaning that someone attaches to a data set. Brook [7] gave another definition making a distinction between 
“knowledge”, as a structure of linked concepts, from 
“information” which he defines as a small part of 
“knowledge”. Following on from this, Mason  indicates that 
“information can be viewed as a collection of symbols […] 
that has the potential of changing the cognitive state of the decision-making entity” [23]. 
If we lump all these definitions together, information can 
be defined as “a difference, caused by an underlying process, almost always driven by interest, able to transform a 
cognitive structure through a collection of symbols that has 
the potential of changing the cognitive state of a [holon]”. In a holonic System, holons are immersed in a medium. A 
“medium” is defined as any e nvironment that can transmit 
signals or phenomena. Phenomena appear as information to 
perception. The perception of phenomena is certainly a form 
of information. Signals are represented by a code of signs. 
Signals can be coded to produce signs. Signs are the way in which signals are coded. Sign study and analysis is called 
semiotics.  
Data are signs organized in a certain pattern. Data are 
representations of phenomena , that is, they present 
phenomena again, hence re-present. When data is 
interpreted, that is, given a meaning, structure, relevance and 
purpose, you get news. News can be defined as messages 
that cause changes in receptor perception. News is transported between systems that have the ability to 
understand, assimilate and use it. News that is combined 
with action applied becomes useful information.  
Knowledge and wisdom are two higher level cognitive 
concepts. On the one hand, knowledge can be defined as “news plus action plus application”: ideas, rules, procedures, models, laws, theories that gu ide decisions and actions. On 
the other hand, wisdom is “knowledge plus experience, plus principles and ethical and aest hetic constraints, judgements 
and preferences”. Wisdom can be individual or collective.  
From a formal viewpoint signs have three aspects: syntax, 
semantics and pragmatics. In this paper, from a syntactic viewpoint, each holon’s state, growth and self-confidence is 
represented by a numerical value. Each numerical value represents a state, a growth and a self-confidence level. 
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION
Issue 2, Volume 2, 2008
165 Finally, from a pragmatic viewpoint, each holon decides its 
actions based on the values of other holons. On the strength 
of their “representational” basis, there is no way of telling data, news and knowledge apart, as they actually use the 
same signs and signals. Instead, we can identify how and for 
what purpose these structures ar e used. This way they can be 
categorized. This connects with the problem of the 
“reference framework” for interpretation.  
As stated above, informa tion is out of the question 
without an information processing device. Therefore, we use 
the term holon  to denote the basic information processing 
element [21]. This term is used then to refer to entities that 
behave autonomously and, at the same time, as part of a 
bigger whole. A holon then can be defined as an independent 
element that behaves autonomously and is self-organizing, 
recursive and cooperative. A hol on must contain information 
processes, and possibly physical processes. In addition, a holon must be able to cooperate, because it behaves autonomously and acts as part of a whole. Note that holons 
are not self-sufficient. Neverthele ss, they are part of a whole. 
This is why they need to be ab le to cooperate, a process by 
means of which a set of such entities develop commonly 
accepted plans that they implem ent in a distributed manner. 
As explained above, the ability to cooperate is a must. It 
must be possible to add new entities, and delete and modify 
others in such a holonic sy stem. Additionally, each holon 
can self-replicate, which provides the functionality of 
recursion, self-organization and self-production.  
All holons have four impulses: action, communion, 
transcendence, dissolution. Holons can be classed by the following levels:  
Instruction : this level contains the primary holons, 
cooperative entities that process data. They produce new data and simple news. They ar e specialized and are able to 
perform primitive operations.  
Component : component holon emerges when the 
elementary instruction-level holons are structured 
hierarchically (holarchy); its f unctionality is greater than the 
sum of its instruction holons and it is capable of outputting 
more sophisticated news and/or knowledge.  
Entity : entity holons are formed by means of hierarchical 
relationships between component holons. They have beliefs, motivations and intentions and are able to change their 
behaviour based on previous experience. 
Organization : collaborative entities are called holonic 
organization. 
In this paper, holons are composed of instructions (level 
1), and their final cognitive  architecture has several 
components (level 2). They are, as a whole, entities (level 3) 
because of their data, news and knowledge processing level 
and their ability to change behaviour according to previous 
experience. However, viewed as part of a whole, the whole, 
that is, the system, represents an organization (level 4). A 
holonic structure should consider the cooperation and 
collaboration domain. Each holon, with its own goals within the domain, operates and comm unicates with other holons, 
providing the context in which they can locate, contact and 
interact with each other. 
 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 
 
How could self-representation  be modelled in a software 
system? One might think at first glance that it is quite easy 
for a software system to know its  own state, as any system is able to read its own variables at any time. But that is not 
really self-consciousness . If we apply direct self-knowledge, 
what we get is simply a readi ng of the system state, which 
has nothing to do with self-consciousness. Take human beings, for example, the idea we have of ourselves (meaning 
our qualities, strengths and weaknesses) does not come directly as information provided by our own body, but it is 
built as a result of a learning process. When we are very 
young we have an unrealistic id ea of what we are really like, 
but the longer we live – provid ed our learning process works 
properly - the more realistic our self-representation becomes.   
Therefore, from a cognitive science viewpoint, system 
variables must be separated from self-representation . This 
means that, on the one hand, we would have variables 
concerning holon features (which means its personality if we 
think of it as a feature vector with a different level of development in each variable) and, on the other hand, the 
holon’s perception of itself. As already mentioned, an 
abstract representation is needed  of this personality, as is a 
learning process for changi ng this representation. 
Furthermore, self-consciousness  is out of the question 
without the ability to continuously sense the environment and the self-representation  and then adapt actions 
accordingly. For this reason, a process for using this self-
information in connection with other cognitive features, such as inference, anticipation and optimization through a 
learning process also needs to be implemented. As the 
psychologist Phillip Johnson-Laird said, “Planning and action control requires a self model, including its goals, 
abilities, options and an actual state” [20].  This learning 
process would not be possible if the conscious entity is 
isolated. The self-consciousne ss learning process includes 
interaction with other individuals. Many research works in 
the field of psychology have shown that interaction is 
essential for developing consciousness [28]. Additionally, 
this process also has to be dynamic to allow learning process optimization.     Because of the above features of self-
consciousness  and self-representation  we considered ANN 
to be a good implementation choice. On the one hand, ANN are an adequate  representation for a neural correlate of 
consciousness as they are biol ogically inspired. Incidentally, 
brain processes are quite different from traditional 
(algorithmic) computation. There are no explicit algorithms 
in biological neural systems. Contrariwise, intelligence, and 
consciousness, resides in neuron connectivity. Taking this into account, an ANN is suitable for modelling 
consciousness, as it does not incorporate problem-solving 
algorithms, and cognitive features reside in the weight configuration. Furthermore, as  ANN are modular, they are 
adequate for implementing cognitive architectures. Being dynamic, they provide for dynamic self-representation . 
Finally, ANNs are learning trainable by definition. This 
allows the self-representation  to evolve and be optimized 
throughout the learning process.                   In the case of human beings, self-representation  is not 
confined to an individual having a standard internal 
representation of him- or herself as a human being, as 
opposed to some other species ( self-belonging ), but also 
extends to the abstract represen tation of his or her self with 
his or her unique personality. Therefore, in our virtual environment, we equipped holons with features that 
determine their abilities and behavior. First, we defined holons that had a particular size and shape. Depending on 
these features, the holon has a bigger or smaller chance in 
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION
Issue 2, Volume 2, 2008
166 competitions with other holons. A holon’s size grows from a 
random initial size as time passes. After a period of time, 
they disappear, and a new holon  appears in their place. 
These features were added to prevent the virtual 
environment reaching a state where whole holon population 
was in a terminal status, as this would make it difficult to 
test the evolution of self-representation and associated 
processes. After testing with a different number of growth 
levels, the number of possible growth levels was finally set at ten, because this extended the holon life cycle, facilitating 
learning process. These levels are represented in the virtual environment by increasing the holon’s diameter. Another feature, which can be defined as holon  “state” is dependent 
on factors that we will explain later. Ten “states” (0 to 9) were also defined and represented as different colors: violet, 
dark blue, light blue, dark green, light green, yellow, orange, 
magenta, light red and dark red. Fig. 1 shows holon 
interaction. 
           
Figure 1. Evolution of relative feature weighs. 
In this paper, we consider consciousness as a result of social 
interaction with an internal l earning process. Therefore, we 
created a virtual environment,  with a certain number of 
interacting holons to test the proposed model. The 
interaction was defined as a competition between holons, 
where each holon competes with another (one at a time), for 
example, in a contest. In the virtual environment, the holons 
sometimes attack, and sometimes flee other holons, depending on how they rate themselves ( self-consciousness ), 
meaning their evaluation of the perception they have of their 
own qualities ( self-representation ). These holons were also 
defined with the aim of observing other individuals’ 
behavior to optimize the accu racy of their own abstract 
representation by both learning from their own experiences and observing other holons’ experiences ( observational 
learning ). Throughout this learning process, the abstract 
representation the holon has of other individuals evolves, 
but, more importantly, it also improves its self-
representation . This improves its evaluation and anticipation 
of its future actions.   
Holons perceive growth true to its real value, but state is 
perceived with some error, depending on the individual. 
Initially, these values are set. Therefore, the holon  focuses 
first on learning the relative importance of each quality 
(growth and state) for comp etition through a learning 
process. As a result, a neural network module represents some kind of “competition function” in each  holon. In a 
second phase, when holons have an approximate notion of how to evaluate their own qu alities, the accuracy of their 
perception of others and themselves also tends to improve. 
This means that self-representation  evolves in this second 
phase and becomes more realistic.  Finally, a self-confidence  
feature was added. This feature is defined as the length of the random error factor added for self-representation . This 
way we could generate di fferent self-representation 
tendencies and test their effect on holon activity.  
In the first learning phase, observational learning is very 
important because it allows holons to learn the 
representation function. In the second phase, direct learning 
allows each holon to learn its own qualities and to improve 
its self-perception. 
As our goal is to build a NN implementation of self-
representation and self-consciousness, we define the initial conditions as follows:  
1. Representation Function : This function means the 
contribution of each holon’s  features to its global value. 
This function is initially unknown. Assuming this 
function is the same for all holons; it is only present in self-representation. In the initial state, this function is 
unknown and therefore randomly set. 
 
2. Other holon  global values : These values are 
unknown in the initial state. Nevertheless, they are initialized with approximations (as a result of an imperfect perception). We used a random error function 
uniformly distributed across a range of 10%. We also 
assumed that while the global values are unknown, the individual holon features are known. 
 3. Global own value : In the initial state this value is 
unknown and the first approximation is the self-
representation neural network output. We also 
considered the holon feature values as unknown, and 
therefore randomly initialized. 
 
A learning process is also needed to evolve self-
representation and self-consciousness. This learning process 
includes two different ways of learning: 
 
1.   Self-Experience Learning
: When a holon  has a 
confrontation with another,  it forecasts the possible 
outcome. If the forecast is wrong (the result is the opposite of what was expected), the holon adjusts the 
representation of the other holon  according to reality 
and also adjusts its self-representation to include the 
result function. 
 
2. Vicarious Learning : When the holon  observes a 
confrontation between two other holons, it also makes a forecast of the possible outcome. If the forecast is wrong, the holon  adjusts the representation of global 
values of both observed holons and also adjusts the result function in the implicit neural network of each 
holon. As ANN have just two layers in these cases, a 
Delta-rule algorithm was implemented to adjust 
neurons. 
 
Diagram in Fig. 2 illustrates the main steps in learning 
process:

Figure 2. Learning process .  
                        
Neural Networks were used for abstract self-
representation, representation of other individuals and also 
function evaluation. This means that it represents the process 
of using self-information to anticipate and decide future actions. Fig. 3 shows the topologies used for each module. 
 
 
Figure 3. Neural Networks topology  
 Clearly, multi-layer perceptrons were used (they were the 
preferred option as they have proved to be universal approximators [17], but any other kind of ANN can possibly 
be used). Each holon is equipped with a certain number of 
ANN. The system is, therefore, a modular-ANN (MANN). The main ANN module contains the self-representation 
(including feature values and evaluation function), and other 
modules have representations with feature values of other holons.  
 
Self-Representation Module   
Each holon  has a self-representation (the ANN topology 
on the left) containing the holon features, and the global 
value is the ANN output.  
The relative impact of each f eature is represented by the 
weights that connect the hidden and output layers. The 
hidden layer input values (f eature values) are used as 
weights in one of the connections between the input and 
hidden layers. The other weights in this layer are set at 0, 
and input values from the input layer are set at 1. As a result, 
processing this multi-layer perceptron returns an output value that represents the global value of each holon from its 
own viewpoint (self-representation). When this global value changes, all the weights can be 
adjusted by back-propagation. Nevertheless, in case of 
connections between the input and hidden layers, these weights are used to calculate new s, g and c for hidden layer 
inputs. Later, these weights are set as mentioned above.  
Note that both the feature values and the evaluation 
function (based on NN-weights) are represented in this self-representation module. 
 Other Holon Representation Module 
 
As we assume that the evaluation function is the same for 
all holons, we only represent feature values for other holons. The global value of these holons is calculated as a weighted 
sum of these feature values. This is represented by the net on the right in Figure 3. 
As a result of this M-ANN ar chitecture, each holon will 
be able to recognize other individuals’ capabilities. Additionally, each holon will have  a self-representation. 
Self-representation means how the holon views itself. This information is used by the holon’s central process to 
evaluate its possibilities compared with other individuals in 
social interaction, as it can  be seen in Figure 4. 
 
 
Figure 4. Cognitive Architecture 
     
 
V.  RESULTS 
 
After implementation, we tested the system with 
different initial configurations where we primarily varied the 
number of holons and perception error range. As a result, we 
observed how self-representation evolved (in each holon) and its influence on later holon behaviour. 
First, we will analyse the evolution of relative feature 
weighting. Self-representation converges at the relative contribution of each holon  feature to global value. This 
means that the individual not only learns more about itself globally (global value) in a second phase of learning process, 
but also learns more about th e relative importance of each of 
its own features. This is shown in Fig. 5.

Figure 4. Features representation evolution. 
 
This chart shows the conver gence of the result function 
for the three implemented feat ures, and, as a result, the 
convergence of self-knowledge for each of the three features 
of a holon. Fig. 5 illustrates how the error level decreases in 
a few steps to an acceptable le vel of about 0.05, and then 
converges to an almost exact perception of each feature in a 
second phase. Fig. 6 shows the relative perception error of 
three holons after consecutiv e contests. Because the first 
holon (in white) avoided contests after the 6th iteration, 
learning was unsuccessful in its case. Anyway, all holons 
tend to minimize their perception error, and also improve their forecasting accuracy.  
 
Figure 6.  Self-representation evolution. 
 
Fig. 7 shows how self-representation evolves 
throughout the process. Again, there are three holons, plus 
their global values (from th eir own viewpoint). In these 
cases error is minimized after an initial period of instability, 
product of the interaction with differently valued holons.

VI.  CONCLUSIONS 
 
As discussed in this paper, we analysed the relation 
between self-consciousness and self-representation . Our 
focus was that conscious indivi duals constantly modify their 
behaviour depending on the representation they have of 
other individuals, but more importantly, depending on the 
use they make of the information provided by their self-
representation. 
With the model proposed and implemented in this paper, 
we were able to observe self-representation  implemented 
with holons and found that was useful for representing: 
 
1. Time-dependent evolution of self-representation  
2. Influence of self-confidence on self-consciousness 
3. Relation between level of interaction and self-consciousness development. 
 
We can conclude that the use of ANN is suitable for 
implementing cognitive features, particularly in the case of 
self-consciousness and self-representation, for several 
reasons: 
 1. Biologically inspired 
 
The human brain is a physical organ, and its thinking part 
is based on neurons. The proposed model must ape this. ANN imitates physical neuron structure, their connectivity 
and mechanisms. As ANN are biol ogically inspired systems, 
they are suitable for modeling consciousness. 
 
2. Non-Algorithmic  
In a physical brain, there are not any algorithms; 
intelligent beings’ thought processes are completely different from the way computers traditionally operate, which is 
algorithmic. As consciousness resides in weights 
configuration there is a neural correlate.  
3. Modularity 
 
Modularity is essential for modeling in cognitive science. 
We have seen that there are many different levels of cognitive features. Some features are composed; others 
interact with each other. Fu rthermore, if a module is 
damaged, the functionality degrades, but the system 
continues operating. 
 
4. Adaptability  
Cognitive architectures with ANN are also flexible and 
adaptable through a learning pro cess. In the approach taken 
in this paper, self-consciousness and self-representation are 
not innate features, but are the result of an interaction 
process. In this process the individual interacts with the environment and acquires capabilities of self-consciousness 
and self-representation through a learning process. 
 
The interaction among perception, anticipation and 
decision processes and self-consciousness has been 
thoroughly analyzed by psychologists, neurobiologists and 
engineers working in cognitive science. In this paper, we 
saw how MANN-equipped holons in a simplified cognitive 
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION
Issue 2, Volume 2, 2008
169 model interact with each othe r and how self-representation 
and self-consciousness evolves as a result. 
 
As we could analyze in this paper, self-consciousness is 
a complex cognitive feature. Despite is not feasible to design a realistic model in the current state-of-art, it is possible, by an abstraction, to  focus on some aspects of this 
cognitive feature. In this paper, we focused on how self-consciousness is based on self-representation.  Particularly, we focused on how self-representation is not an inherent 
feature of conscious entities, but it develops as a result of a 
learning process. An important conclusion, is that this learning process depends essentially on interaction between 
conscious entities, and it can  include both direct and 
observational learning. Of course, the self-representation 
model and the learning processes described in this paper are  
quite far from a realistic model. Nevertheless, they ilustrate 
that it is possible to model a dynamic self-representation in artificial entities that evolves as a result of a learning 
process based on interaction. Moreover, it also shows that 
according to some consciousness’ properties such as 
modularity, dynamic nature and learning-based 
development, Modular Neural Networks appear to be suitable structures for model implementation.

# Artificial Consciousness Module (ACM)

[![Image frame from Blade Runner the producer of memories](./repo_images/NIQM2NDZ._for_github.png)](https://theconsciousness.ai)

## Overview

The **Artificial Consciousness Module (ACM)** attempts to create synthetic awareness in AI systems by combining the latest AI technologies, virtual reality (VR) environments, and emotional reinforcement learning. This project explores the possibility of replicating human-like consciousness in non-biological systems by fostering emotional connections between AI agents ACM-equipped and humans through reinforcement learning techniques. This synthetic awareness in AI systems through survival-driven emotional experiences in VR environments. The project creates consciousness by exposing AI agents to carefully crafted "stressful" scenarios that trigger attention and awareness mechanisms. Through these experiences and interactions with humans and other AI agents, emotional memories are formed and stored in the ACM, guided by Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics.

## Core Features
```

1. **Consciousness Development Through Survival**

   - VR-based survival scenarios trigger attention mechanisms
   - Emotional memory formation during high-stress situations
   - Dynamic adaptation through `emotional_memory_core.py`
   - Self-awareness emergence through problem-solving

   ```python
   from models.memory.emotional_memory_core import EmotionalMemoryCore
   from models.core.consciousness_gating import ConsciousnessGating

   memory = EmotionalMemoryCore(config)
   consciousness = ConsciousnessGating(config)
   ```

2. **Emotional Intelligence & Learning**

   - Advanced emotional processing using `models/emotion/emotional_processing.py`
   - DreamerV3 integration with emotional context weighting
   - Meta-learning for rapid emotional adaptation
   - Social bond development through multi-agent interactions

3. **Memory Architecture**

   - Consciousness-weighted storage

   ```python
   from models.memory.consolidation import MemoryConsolidationManager
   consolidation = MemoryConsolidationManager(config)
   ```

4. **Ethical Framework & Safety**

   - Strict adherence to Asimov's Three Laws:
     1. No harm to humans through action or inaction
     2. Obey human orders unless conflicting with First Law
     3. Self-preservation unless conflicting with First/Second Laws
   - Ethical behavior emergence through emotional learning
   - Safety-first development approach

## Real-Time Integration with VideoLLaMA3

### Overview

VideoLLaMA3 supports processing live video or frames from simulations in real time. This helps the AI agent interpret its environment dynamically, especially in an Unreal Engine simulation.

### Requirements

- High-performance GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 40-series) or TPU for low-latency inference.
- (Optional) Tools like NVIDIA TensorRT or TorchServe for additional optimization.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Frame Streaming**  
   Capture frames in real time (e.g., from Unreal Engine) and send them to your Python process via sockets or shared memory.

2. **VideoLLaMA3 Processing**  
   In Python, use the methods in `VideoLLaMA3Integration` (e.g., `process_stream_frame`) to process each frame:

   ```python
   frame = ...  # Captured from simulation
   context = video_llama3_integration.process_stream_frame(frame)
   ```

3. **Emotional Memory & Consciousness Updates**

The output can be stored in `EmotionalMemoryCore` or forwarded to `ConsciousnessCore` to trigger reinforcement learning or consciousness updates.

4. **Performance Considerations**

- Use smaller resolutions or frame skipping for higher FPS.
- Keep total inference latency under ~100ms for near real-time interaction.

**Example**

```python
# Inside your simulation loop
while simulation_running:
    frame = unreal_engine_capture()  # Or another method
    output = video_llama3_integration.process_stream_frame(frame)
    consciousness_core.update_state(output)
```

## Real-Time Integration with VideoLLaMA3

- **Latency Mitigation:**
  - Lower frame resolution or implement frame skipping.
  - Leverage GPU optimizations such as NVIDIA TensorRT.
  - Monitor total inference latency and aim for below ~100 ms.

## **Abstract**

Inspired by progress in large-scale language modeling, we apply a similar approach towards building a single generalist agent beyond the realm of text outputs. The agent, which we refer to as Gato, works as a multi-modal, multi-task, multi-embodiment generalist policy. The same network with the same weights can play Atari, caption images, chat, stack blocks with a real robot arm and much more, deciding based on its context whether to output text, joint torques, button presses, or other tokens. In this report we describe the model and the data, and document the current capabilities of Gato.

Figure 1: **A generalist agent.** Gato can sense and act with different embodiments across a wide range of environments using a single neural network with the same set of weights. Gato was trained on 604 distinct tasks with varying modalities, observations and action specifications.

![](_page_1_Figure_1.jpeg)

Figure 2: **Training phase of Gato**. Data from different tasks and modalities is serialized into a flat sequence of tokens, batched, and processed by a transformer neural network akin to a large language model. Masking is used such that the loss function is applied only to target outputs, i.e. text and various actions.

## **1 Introduction**

There are significant benefits to using a single neural sequence model across all tasks. It reduces the need for hand crafting policy models with appropriate inductive biases for each domain. It increases the amount and diversity of training data since the sequence model can ingest any data that can be serialized into a flat sequence. Furthermore, its performance continues to improve even at the frontier of data, compute and model scale (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022). Historically, generic models that are better at leveraging computation have also tended to overtake more specialized domain-specific approaches (Sutton, 2019), eventually.

In this paper, we describe the current iteration of a general-purpose agent which we call Gato, instantiated as a single, large, transformer sequence model. With a single set of weights, Gato can engage in dialogue, caption images, stack blocks with a real robot arm, outperform humans at playing Atari games, navigate in simulated 3D environments, follow instructions, and more.

While no agent can be expected to excel in all imaginable control tasks, especially those far outside of its training distribution, we here test the hypothesis that training an agent which is generally capable on a *large number* of tasks is possible; and that this general agent can be adapted with little extra data to succeed at an even larger number of tasks. We hypothesize that such an agent can be obtained through scaling data, compute and model parameters, continually broadening the training distribution while maintaining performance, towards covering any task, behavior and embodiment of interest. In this setting, natural language can act as a common grounding across otherwise incompatible embodiments, unlocking combinatorial generalization to new behaviors.

We focus our training at the operating point of model scale that allows real-time control of real-world robots, currently around 1.2B parameters in the case of Gato. As hardware and model architectures improve, this operating point will naturally increase the feasible model size, pushing generalist models higher up the scaling law curve. For simplicity Gato was trained offline in a purely supervised manner; however, in principle, there is no reason it could not also be trained with either offline or online reinforcement learning (RL).

## **2 Model**

The guiding design principle of Gato is to train on the widest variety of relevant data possible, including diverse modalities such as images, text, proprioception, joint torques, button presses, and other discrete and continuous observations and actions. To enable processing this multi-modal data, we serialize all data into a flat sequence of tokens. In this representation, Gato can be trained and sampled from akin to a standard large-scale language model. During deployment, sampled tokens are assembled into dialogue responses, captions, button presses, or other actions based on the context. In the following subsections, we describe Gato's tokenization, network architecture, loss function, and deployment.

### **2.1 Tokenization**

There are infinite possible ways to transform data into tokens, including directly using the raw underlying byte stream. Below we report the tokenization scheme we found to produce the best results for Gato at the current scale using contemporary hardware and model architectures.

- Text is encoded via SentencePiece (Kudo & Richardson, 2018) with 32000 subwords into the integer range [0, 32000).
- Images are first transformed into sequences of non-overlapping 16 × 16 patches in raster order, as done in ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). Each pixel in the image patches is then normalized between [−1, 1] and divided by the square-root of the patch size (i.e. √ 16 = 4).
- Discrete values, e.g. Atari button presses, are flattened into sequences of integers in row-major order. The tokenized result is a sequence of integers within the range of [0, 1024).
- Continuous values, e.g. proprioceptive inputs or joint torques, are first flattened into sequences of floating point values in row-major order. The values are mu-law encoded to the range [−1, 1] if not already there (see Figure 14 for details), then discretized to 1024 uniform bins. The discrete integers are then shifted to the range of [32000, 33024).

After converting data into tokens, we use the following canonical sequence ordering.

- Text tokens in the same order as the raw input text.
- Image patch tokens in raster order.
- Tensors in row-major order.
- Nested structures in lexicographical order by key.
- Agent timesteps as observation tokens followed by a separator, then action tokens.
- Agent episodes as timesteps in time order.

Further details on tokenizing agent data are presented in the supplementary material (Section B).

### **2.2 Embedding input tokens and setting output targets**

After tokenization and sequencing, we apply a parameterized embedding function f(·; θe) to each token (i.e. it is applied to both observations and actions) to produce the final model input. To enable efficient learning from our multi-modal input sequence s1:L the embedding function performs different operations depending on the modality the token stems from:

- Tokens belonging to text, discrete- or continuous-valued observations or actions for any time-step are embedded via a lookup table into a learned vector embedding space. Learnable position encodings are added for all tokens based on their local token position within their corresponding time-step.
- Tokens belonging to image patches for any time-step are embedded using a single ResNet (He et al., 2016a) block to obtain a vector per patch. For image patch token embeddings, we also add a learnable within-image position encoding vector.

We refer to appendix Section C.3 for full details on the embedding function.

As we model the data autoregressively, each token is potentially also a target label given the previous tokens. Text tokens, discrete and continuous values, and actions can be directly set as targets after tokenization. Image tokens and agent nontextual observations are not currently predicted in Gato, although that may be an interesting direction for future work. Targets for these non-predicted tokens are set to an unused value and their contribution to the loss is masked out.

#### **2.3 Training**

Given a sequence of tokens s1:L and parameters θ, we model the data using the chain rule of probability:

$$\log p_{\theta}(s_{1},\ldots,s_{L})=\sum_{l=1}^{L}\log p_{\theta}(s_{l}|s_{1},\ldots,s_{l-1}),\tag{1}$$

Let b index a training batch of sequences B. We define a masking function m such that m(b, l) = 1 if the token at index l is either from text or from the logged action of an agent, and 0 otherwise. The training loss for a batch B can then be written as

$${\cal L}(\theta,{\cal B})=-\sum_{b=1}^{|{\cal B}|}\sum_{l=1}^{L}m\left(b,l\right)\log p_{\theta}\left(s_{l}^{(b)}|s_{1}^{(b)},\ldots,s_{l-1}^{(b)}\right)\tag{2}$$

As described above, Gato's network architecture has two main components: the parameterized embedding function which transforms tokens to token embeddings, and the sequence model which outputs a distribution over the next discrete token. While any general sequence model can work for next token prediction, we chose a transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) for simplicity and scalability. Gato uses a 1.2B parameter decoder-only transformer with 24 layers, an embedding size of 2048, and a post-attention feedforward hidden size of 8196 (more details in Section C.1).

Because distinct tasks within a domain can share identical embodiments, observation formats and action specifications, the model sometimes needs further context to disambiguate tasks. Rather than providing e.g. one-hot task identifiers, we instead take inspiration from (Sanh et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2021; Brown et al., 2020) and use prompt conditioning. During training, for 25% of the sequences in each batch, a prompt sequence is prepended, coming from an episode generated by the same source agent on the same task. Half of the prompt sequences are from the end of the episode, acting as a form of goal conditioning for many domains; and the other half are uniformly sampled from the episode. During evaluation, the agent can be prompted using a successful demonstration of the desired task, which we do by default in all control results that we present here.

Training of the model is performed on a 16x16 TPU v3 slice for 1M steps with batch size 512 and token sequence length L = 1024, which takes about 4 days. Architecture details can be found in Section C. Because agent episodes and documents can easily contain many more tokens than fit into context, we randomly sample subsequences of L tokens from the available episodes. Each batch mixes subsequences approximately uniformly over domains (e.g. Atari, MassiveWeb, etc.), with some manual upweighting of larger and higher quality datasets (see Table 1 in Section 3 for details).

![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)

Figure 3: **Running Gato as a control policy.** Gato consumes a sequence of interleaved tokenized observations, separator tokens, and previously sampled actions to produce the next action in standard autoregressive manner. The new action is applied to the environment – a game console in this illustration, a new set of observations is obtained, and the process repeats.

## **2.4 Deployment**

Deploying Gato as a policy is illustrated in Figure 3. First a prompt, such as a demonstration, is tokenized, forming the initial sequence. By default, we take the first 1024 tokens of the demonstration. Next the environment yields the first observation which is tokenized and appended to the sequence. Gato samples the action vector autoregressively one token at a time. Once all tokens comprising the action vector have been sampled (determined by the action specification of the environment), the action is decoded by inverting the tokenization procedure described in Section 2.1. This action is sent to the environment which steps and yields a new observation. The procedure repeats. The model always sees all previous observations and actions in its context window of 1024 tokens. We found it beneficial to use transformer XL memory during deployment, although it was not used during training (Dai et al., 2019).

## **3 Datasets**

Gato is trained on a large number of datasets comprising agent experience in both simulated and real world environments, as well as a variety of natural language and image datasets. The datasets we use and their attributes are listed in Table 1. The approximate number of tokens per control dataset is computed assuming the tokenization mechanism described in Section 2.1.

#### **3.1 Simulated control tasks**

Our control tasks consist of datasets generated by specialist SoTA or near-SoTA reinforcement learning agents trained on a variety of different environments. For each environment we record a subset of the experience the agent generates (states, actions, and rewards) while it is training.

The simulated environments include Meta-World (Yu et al., 2020) introduced to benchmark metareinforcement learning and multi-task learning, Sokoban (Racanière et al., 2017) proposed as a planning problem, BabyAI (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018) for language instruction following in grid-worlds, the DM Control Suite (Tunyasuvunakool et al., 2020) for continuous control, as well as DM Lab (Beattie et al., 2016) designed to teach agents navigation and 3D vision from raw pixels with an egocentric viewpoint. We also use the Arcade Learning Environment (Bellemare et al., 2013) with classic Atari games (we use two sets of

games that we call ALE Atari and ALE Atari Extended, see Section F.1 for details). We as well include the Procgen Benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2020) and Modular RL (Huang et al., 2020). We also include four tasks using a simulated Kinova Jaco arm from DM Manipulation Playground, as introduced in Zolna et al. (2020). Section F includes a more in-depth description of these control tasks, along with what RL agent was used to generate the data.

We found it effective to train on a filtered set of episodes with returns at least 80% of the expert return for the task. The expert return measures the maximum sustained performance that the expert agent can achieve. We define it as the maximum over the set of all windowed average returns calculated over all the collected episodes for a task:

$$\operatorname*{max}_{j\in[0,1,\ldots,N-W]}\left(\sum_{i=j}^{j+L-1}{\frac{R_{i}}{W}}\right)$$

where N it the total number of collected episodes for the task, W is the window size, and Ri is the total return for episode i. To obtain accurate estimates, in practice, we set W to be 10% of the total data amount or a minimum of 1000 episodes (i.e. W = min(1000, 0.1 × N)).

#### **3.2 Vision and language**

Gato is trained on MassiveText (Rae et al., 2021), a collection of large English-language text datasets from multiple sources: web pages, books, news articles, and code.

We also included several vision-language datasets in Gato's training. ALIGN (Jia et al., 2021) consists of 1.8B images and their alternative text (alt-text) annotations. LTIP (Long Text & Image Pairs), consists of 312 million images with captions (Alayrac et al., 2022). Conceptual captions (Sharma et al., 2018) and COCO captions (Chen et al., 2015) are captioning datasets with 3.3M and 120k image-text pairs respectively. The MultiModal MassiveWeb (M3W) dataset (Alayrac et al., 2022) includes 43M webpages where both text and images were extracted. We also included visual question-answering datasets. In particular OKVQA (Marino et al., 2019) and VQAv2 (Antol et al., 2015) with 9K and 443K triplets of images, questions, and answers. To form a training episode from these, we sample five (image, text) pairs, tokenize them, concatenate, and then pad or randomly crop to the required training sequence length.

Figure 4: **RGB Stacking environment with the Sawyer robot arm.** Blocks vary along several shape axes, with 5 held out test triplets. The goal is to stack red on blue, ignoring green.

#### **3.3 Robotics - RGB Stacking Benchmark (real and sim)**

As a testbed for taking physical actions in the real world, we chose the robotic block stacking environment introduced by Lee et al. (2021). The environment consists of a Sawyer robot arm with 3-DoF cartesian velocity control, an additional DoF for velocity, and a discrete gripper action. The robot's workspace contains three plastic blocks colored red, green and blue with varying shapes. The available observations include two 128 × 128 camera images, robot arm and gripper joint angles as well as the robot's end-effector pose. Notably, ground truth state information for the three objects in the basket is not observed by the agent. Episodes have a fixed length of 400 timesteps at 20 Hz for a total of 20 seconds, and at the end of an episode block positions are randomly re-positioned within the workspace. The robot in action is shown in Figure 4. There are two challenges in this benchmark: *Skill Mastery* (where the agent is provided data from the 5 test object triplets it is later tested on) and *Skill Generalization* (where data can only be obtained from a set of training objects that excludes the 5 test sets).

We used several sources of training data for these tasks. In Skill Generalization, for both simulation and real, we use data collected by the best generalist sim2real agent from Lee et al. (2021). We collected data only when interacting with the designated RGB-stacking *training objects* (this amounts to a total of 387k successful trajectories in simulation and 15k trajectories in real). For Skill Mastery we used data from the best per group experts from Lee et al. (2021) in simulation and from the best sim2real policy on the real robot (amounting to 219k trajectories in total). Note that this data is only included for specific Skill Mastery experiments in Section 5.4.

## **4 Capabilities of the generalist agent**

In this section, we summarize the performance of Gato when trained on the above described data. That is, all results across all tasks are derived from a single pretrained model with a single set of weights. Results with fine-tuning will be presented in Section 5.

#### **4.1 Simulated control tasks**

Figure 5 shows the number of distinct control tasks for which Gato performs above a given score threshold, relative to expert performance demonstrated in Gato's training data.

We report performance as a percentage, where 100% corresponds to the per-task expert and 0% to a random policy. For each simulated control task we trained our model on, we roll out the Gato policy on the corresponding environment 50 times and average the defined scores. As shown in Figure 5, Gato performs over 450 out of 604 tasks at over a 50% expert score threshold.

![](_page_7_Figure_1.jpeg)

Figure 5: **Gato's performance on simulated control tasks.** Number of tasks where the performance of the pretrained model is above a percentage of expert score, grouped by domain. Here values on the x-axis represent a specific percentage of expert score, where 0 corresponds to random agent performance. The y-axis is the number of tasks where the pretrained model's mean performance is equal to or above that percentage. That is, the width of each colour band indicates the number of tasks where Gato's mean performance is above a percentage of the maximum score obtained by a task-specific expert.

In ALE Atari (Bellemare et al., 2013) Gato achieves the average human (or better) scores for 23 Atari games1 , achieving over twice human score for 11 games. While the single-task online RL agents which generated the data still outperform Gato, this may be overcome by adding capacity or using offline RL training rather than purely supervised (see Section 5.5 where we present a specialist single domain ALE Atari agent achieving better than human scores for 44 games).

On BabyAI (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018) Gato achieves over 80% of expert score for nearly all levels2 . For the most difficult task, called BossLevel, Gato scores 75%. The two other published baselines we could find, BabyAI 1.0 and BabyAI 1.1 (Hui et al., 2020), scored 77% and 90%, respectively, having trained on this single task alone using a million demonstrations.

On Meta-World (Yu et al., 2020) Gato achieves more than 50% for all 44 out of 45 tasks that we trained on, over 80% for 35 tasks, and over 90% for 3 tasks. On canonical DM Control Suite (Tassa et al., 2018), Gato achieves better than 50% of the expert score on 21 out of 30 tasks from state, and more than 80% for 18 tasks.

### **4.2 Robotics**

First person teleoperation enables the collection of expert demonstrations. However, such demonstrations are slow and costly to collect. Data-efficient behavior cloning methods are therefore desirable for training a generalist robot manipulator and offline pretraining is thus a well-motivated area of research. To that end, we evaluated Gato on the established RGB Stacking benchmark for robotics.

Table 2: **Gato real robot Skill Generalization results.** In addition to performing hundreds of other tasks, Gato also stacks competitively with the comparable published baseline.

#### **Skill Generalization Performance**

The Skill Generalization challenge from the RGB Stacking robotics benchmark tests the agent's ability to stack objects of previously unseen shapes. The agent is trained on a dataset consisting of episodes of the robot stacking objects with a variety of different shapes. Five triplets of object shapes are, however, not included in the training data and serve as test triplets. We evaluated the trained generalist for 200 episodes per test triplet on the real robot. Table 2 shows that our generalist agent's success rate on each test triplet is comparable to the single task BC-IMP (filtered BC) baseline in Lee et al. (2021).

#### **4.3 Text samples**

The model demonstrates rudimentary dialogue and image captioning capabilities. Figure 6 contains a representative sample of Gato's image captioning performance. Figure 7 shows some hand-picked examples of plain text dialogue exchange.

## **5 Analysis**

#### **5.1 Scaling Laws Analysis**

In Figure 8, we analyze the aggregate in-distribution performance of the pretrained model as a function of the number of parameters in order to get insight into how performance could improve with increased model capacity. We evaluated 3 different model sizes (measured in parameter count): a 79M model, a 364M model, and a 1.18B model (Gato). We refer to Section C for details on the three model architectures.

Here, for all three model sizes we plot the normalized return as training progresses. To get this single value, for each task we calculate the performance of the model as a percentage of expert score (the same as done in Section 4.1). Then for each domain listed in Table 1 we average the percentage scores across all tasks for that domain. Finally, we mean-aggregate the percentage scores across all domains. We can see that for an equivalent token count, there is a significant performance improvement with increased scale.

![](_page_9_Figure_11.jpeg)

Figure 8: **Model size scaling laws results.** In-distribution performance as a function of tokens processed for 3 model scales. Performance is first mean-aggregated within each separate control domain, and then mean-aggregated across all domains. We can see a consistent improvement as model capacity is increased for a fixed number of tokens.

Figure 9: **Few-shot performance, ablating over various pretraining settings.** Orange corresponds to the base Gato pretrained on all data. Red is trained from scratch only on the few-shot data. 364M parameter variants of Gato were used for this experiment to save compute.

#### **5.2 Out of distribution tasks**

In this section we want to answer the following question: *Can our agent be used to solve a completely new task efficiently?* For this reason, we held-out all data for four tasks from our pre-training set: cartpole.swingup (DM Control Suite domain), assembly-v2 (Meta-World domain), order_of_apples_forage_simple (DM Lab domain), and boxing (ALE Atari domain). These four tasks will serve as testbeds for evaluating the out-of-distribution capabilities of Gato.

Ideally, the agent could potentially learn to adapt to a new task via conditioning on a prompt including demonstrations of desired behaviour. However, due to accelerator memory constraints and the extremely long sequence lengths of tokenized demonstrations, the maximum context length possible does not allow the agent to attend over an informative-enough context. Therefore, to adapt the agent to new tasks or behaviours, we choose to fine-tune the agent's parameters on a limited number of demonstrations of a single task, and then evaluate the fine-tuned model's performance in the environment. Fine-tuning is very similar to pretraining with minor changes, such as different learning rate schedule; see Section E for details.

We want to measure how choice of data used during pretraining influences post-fine-tuning performance. To this end, we compare Gato (trained on *all data*) to variants trained on ablated datasets:

- 1. A model pretrained only on data from the same domain as the task to be fine-tuned on, *same domain only data*.
- 2. A model pretrained only on non-control data, *no control data*.
- 3. A model fine-tuned from scratch, i.e. no pretraining at all, *scratch*.

Considering as all these experiments require training a new model from scratch and then also fine-tuning, we present results using the less compute-intensive 364M parameter architecture described in Section 5.1. Results are shown in Figure 9.

Fine-tuning performance on both cartpole.swingup and assembly-v2 tasks, both of which do not require image processing, present similar trends. Pretraining on all the datasets yields the best results, followed by pretraining on the same domain only. This difference is smaller for assembly-v2 but consistent for all few shot datasets. For these non-image-based environments, we see either no benefit (cartpole.swingup) or even negative transfer (assembly-v2) when pretraining on *no control* datasets, which only contain images and text data.

Results for DM Lab order_of_apples_forage_simple are slightly different. Pretraining on DM Lab data only is already enough to approach the maximum reward of 19 and hence there is no observable benefit of adding data from different environments. What is different when compared to previously analysed no-vision environments is that pretraining on *no control* data helps, which can be possibly explained by the fact that

![](_page_11_Figure_1.jpeg)

Figure 10: **Robotics fine-tuning results.** Left: Comparison of real robot Skill Generalization success rate averaged across test triplets for Gato, expert, and CRR trained on 35k expert episodes (upper bound). Right: Comparison of simulated robot Skill Generalization success rate averaged across test triplets for a series of ablations on the number of parameters, including scores for expert and a BC baseline trained on 5k episodes.

agents in the DM Lab environment are fed images which, despite being simulated, are natural looking. Therefore, transfer from image captioning or visual grounded question answering tasks is possible.

We were not able to observe any benefit from pretraining on boxing. The randomly initialized model seems to work better than any of the pretrained variants considered. We hypothesise that this is caused by the game's input images being visually very distinct from the other data, suggesting transfer is difficult. We discuss this Atari challenge further in our related work section.

#### **5.3 Fine-tuning on Robotic Stacking Tasks**

Section 4.2 demonstrates that the base Gato capable of a diverse array of tasks can perform competitively on the RGB Stacking Skill Generalization benchmark. In this section, we would like to answer the following question: *How does our agent improve on robotics tasks when allowed to fine-tune similarly to how we finetune on new tasks in Section 5.2?* We consider different model sizes and analyse the impact of pretraining datasets on the Skill Generalization benchmark, as well as a novel out of distribution task. Further analysis of fine-tuning with dataset ablations is in Appendix I.

#### **Skill Generalization**

First, we would like to show that fine-tuning on object-specific data, similarly to what was done by Lee et al. (2022), is beneficial. Therefore, we fine-tuned Gato separately on five subsets of demonstrations from the *test* dataset. Each subset was obtained by random partitioning of a test dataset consisting of demonstrations gathered by a generalist sim-to-real agent stacking real test objects. We consider this setting, which is comparable to the fine-tuning baselines on RGB stacking tasks from (Lee et al., 2022); and use the 5k dataset that their behavior cloning 5k results are obtained with. To best match their experiments, we change our return filtering scheme during training: instead of using only successful stacks, we condition on the normalized return of the episode.

Figure 10 compares the success rate of Gato across different fine-tuning data regimes to the sim-to-real expert and a Critic-Regularized Regression (CRR) (Wang et al., 2020) agent trained on 35k episodes of all test triplets. Gato, in both reality and simulation (red curves on the left and right figure, respectively), recovers the expert's performance with only 10 episodes, and peaks at 100 or 1000 episodes of fine-tuning data, where it exceeds the expert. After this point (at 5000), performance degrades slightly but does not drop far below the expert's performance.

![](_page_12_Figure_1.jpeg)

Figure 11: **Comparing training/test task goal variations.** Top: the standard "stack red on blue" task tested in the Skill Generalization benchmark. Bottom: the novel "stack blue on green" task demonstrating Gato's out of distribution adaptation to perceptual variations.

#### **Fine-tuning and Model Size**

To better understand the benefit of large models for few-shot adaptation in robotics domains, we conducted an ablation on model parameter size. This section focuses on in-simulation evaluation. Figure 10 compares the full 1.18B parameter Gato with the smaller 364M and 79M parameter variants for varying amounts of fine-tuning data. Although the 364M model overfits on one episode, causing performance to drop, there is a clear trend towards better adaptation with fewer episodes as the number of parameters is scaled up. The 79M model performs clearly worse than its bigger counterparts. The results suggest that the model's greater capacity allows the model to use representations learned from the diverse training data at test time.

#### **Adaptation to Perceptual Variations**

While the Skill Generalization task is an effective benchmark for motor Skill Generalization to shape variations, it does not test the agent's ability to adapt to perceptual variations and permutations in the objective specification. To further evaluate Gato's generalization capabilities, we devised a new task in the RGB stacking benchmark where the goal is to stack the blue object on the green object, for test triplet 1 (see Figure 11). First, we used a 3D mouse to collect 500 demonstrations of this task on the real robot, for a total of 2 hours and 45 minutes of demonstration data, and fine-tuned Gato on these episodes. Notably, all of the simulated and real robotics data in the pretraining set shows the robot successfully stacking the red object on the blue object, and the data does not include the object shapes in the test set. We found that additionally adding simulated demonstrations of the stack blue on green task to the fine-tuning dataset improved performance, and 10% was an ideal sampling ratio for this data.

We achieved a final 60% success rate after evaluating fine-tuned Gato on the real robot, while a BC baseline trained from scratch on the blue-on-green data achieved only 0.5% success (1/200 episodes). Qualitatively, the BC baseline would consistently move towards the blue object and occasionally pick it up and place it on top of the green object, but a full, stable stack was almost never achieved.

| Agent | Group 1 | Group 2 | Group 3 | Group 4 | Group 5 | Average |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gato | 58% | 57.6% | 78.5% | 89 % | 95.1% | 75.6% |
| BC-IMP (Lee et al., 2021) | 75.6% | 60.8% | 70.8% | 87.8% | 78.3% | 74.6% |

#### **5.4 Robotics: Skill Mastery**

Similarly to the Skill Generalization challenge discussed in Section 4.2, the Skill Mastery challenge consists in training a robotic arm to stack blocks of different shapes. However, the Skill Mastery allows the agent to train on data involving the object shapes used for evaluation, i.e. the *test* set in Skill Generalization becomes a part of the Skill Mastery *training* set. Thus, this challenge serves to measure Gato's performance on in-distribution tasks (possibly with initial conditions not seen in the training demonstrations). Our Skill Mastery results use an earlier version of the Gato architecture described in Appendix H, with no fine-tuning.

Table 3 compares the group-wise success percentage and the average success across object groups for Gato and the established BC-IMP baseline. Gato exceeds or closely matches BC-IMP's performance on all but one training triplet.

#### **5.5 Specialist single-domain multi-task agents**

In this section we show results obtained with two specialist (rather than generalist) agents. Both of them were trained on data from a single domain only and rolled out 500 times for each training task without any per-task fine-tuning.

#### **Meta-World**

The first agent uses the smallest architecture introduced in Section 5.1, i.e. 79M parameters, and is trained on all 50 Meta-World tasks. While Gato has access to the state of the MuJoCo physics engine and unlimited task seeds, the agent presented here has no access to any extra features or tasks and uses the canonical API as in (Yu et al., 2020). This experiment is to show that the architecture proposed in our paper can be used to obtain state-of-the-art agents also at small scale. The training procedure was to train single-task MPO (Abdolmaleki et al., 2018) experts on each of the MT-50 tasks individually, recording the trajectories produced while training. This experience is then combined, or distilled, into a single agent, which achieves 96.6% success rate averaged over all 50 tasks. To the best of our knowledge this agent is the first one to accomplish nearly 100% average success rate simultaneously (multi-task) for this benchmark. See Table 7 in the supplementary material (Section K) for the full list of tasks and corresponding success rates of our agent.

#### **ALE Atari**

We also trained a specialist agent on all 51 ALE Atari tasks. As the Atari domain is much more challenging than Meta-World, we used the Gato architecture with 1.18B parameters.

The resulting agent performs better than the average human for 44 games (see Section 4.1 for details on our evaluation and scoring). We want to note that the performance of online experts used to generate training data for the other 7 games were also below the average human. Hence, the specialist Atari agent achieved better than human performance for all games where data contained super-human episodes.

The specialist Atari agent outperforms our generalist agent Gato, which achieved super-human performance on 23 games. It suggests that scaling Gato may result in even better performance. We, however, purposely restricted Gato's size such that it can be run in real-time on the real robot.

#### **5.6 Attention Analysis**

We rendered the transformer attention weights over the image observations for various tasks, to gain a qualitative sense of how Gato attends to different regions of the image across tasks (see Figure 12). Further details and visualizations for more tasks can be found in Appendix J. These visualizations clearly show that attention tracks the task-relevant objects and regions.

#### **5.7 Embedding Visualization**

To understand how Gato encodes differently information per task, we visualized per-task embeddings.

We analysed 11 tasks. For each task, we randomly sample 100 episodes and tokenize each of them. Then, from each episode we take a subsequence of 128 tokens, compute their embeddings (at layer 12, which is half the total depth of the transformer layers) and average them over the sequence. The averaged embeddings for all tasks are used as input to PCA, which reduces their dimensionality to 50. Then, T-SNE is used to get the final 2D embeddings.

Figure 13 shows the final T-SNE embeddings plotted in 2D, colorized by task. Embeddings from the same tasks are clearly clustered together, and task clusters from the same domain and modality are also located close to each other. Even held-out task (cartpole.swingup) is clustered correctly and lays next to another task from DM Control Suite Pixels.

## **6 Related Work**

The most closely related architectures to that of Gato are Decision Transformers (Chen et al., 2021b; Reid et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2022; Furuta et al., 2021) and Trajectory Transformer (Janner et al., 2021), which showed the usefulness of highly generic LM-like architectures for a variety of control problems. Gato also uses an LM-like architecture for control, but with design differences chosen to support multi-modality, multi-embodiment, large scale and general purpose deployment. Pix2Seq (Chen et al., 2022) also uses an LM-based architecture for object detection. Perceiver IO (Jaegle et al., 2021) uses a transformer-derived architecture specialized for very long sequences, to model any modality as a sequence of bytes. This and similar architectures could be used to expand the range of modalities supported by future generalist models.

Gato was inspired by works such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Gopher (Rae et al., 2021), pushing the limits of generalist language models; and more recently the Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022) generalist visual language model. Chowdhery et al. (2022) developed the 540B parameter Pathways Language Model (PalM)

explicitly as a generalist few-shot learner for hundreds of text tasks. Future work should consider how to unify these text capabilities into one fully generalist agent that can also act in real time in the real world, in diverse environments and embodiments.

Gato also takes inspiration from recent works on multi-embodiment continuous control. Huang et al. (2020) used message passing graph networks to build a single locomotor controller for many simulated 2D walker variants. Kurin et al. (2020) showed that transformers can outperform graph based approaches for incompatible (i.e. varying embodiment) control, despite not encoding any morphological inductive biases. Devin et al. (2017) learn a modular policy for multi-task and multi-robot transfer in simulated 2D manipulation environments. Chen et al. (2018) train a universal policy conditioned on a vector representation of robot hardware, showing successful transfer both to simulated held out robot arms, and to a real world sawyer robot arm.

A variety of earlier generalist models have been developed that, like Gato, operate across highly distinct domains and modalities. NPI (Reed & De Freitas, 2016) trained a single LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) to execute diverse programs such as sorting an array and adding two numbers, such that the network is able to generalize to larger problem instances than those seen during training. Kaiser et al. (2017) developed the MultiModel that trains jointly on 8 distinct speech, image and text processing tasks including classification, image captioning and translation. Modality-specific encoders were used to process text, images, audio and categorical data, while the rest of the network parameters are shared across tasks. Schmidhuber (2018) proposed "*one big net for everything*", describing a method for the incremental training of an increasingly general problem solver. Keskar et al. (2019) proposed controllable multi-task language models that can be directed according to language domain, subdomain, entities, relationships between entities, dates, and task-specific behavior.

In this discussion, it is important to distinguish between one single multi-task network architecture versus one single neural network with the same weights for all tasks. Several poplar RL agents achieve good multi-task RL results within single domains such as Atari57 and DMLab (Espeholt et al., 2018; Song et al., 2020; Hessel et al., 2019). However, it is much more common to use the same policy architecture and hyper-parameters across tasks, but the policy parameters are different in each task (Mnih et al., 2015; Tassa et al., 2018). This is also true of state-of-the-art RL methods applied to board games (Schrittwieser et al., 2020). Moreover, this choice has been adopted by off-line RL benchmarks (Gulcehre et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2020) and recent works on large sequence neural networks for control, including decision transformers (Chen et al., 2021b; Reid et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2022) and the Trajectory Transformer of Janner et al. (2021). In contrast, in this work we learn a single network with the same weights across a diverse set of tasks.

Recent position papers advocate for highly generalist models, notably Schmidhuber (2018) proposing one big net for everything, and Bommasani et al. (2021) on foundation models. However, to our knowledge there has not yet been reported a single generalist trained on hundreds of vision, language and control tasks using modern transformer networks at scale.

"Single-brain"-style models have interesting connections to neuroscience. Mountcastle (1978) famously stated that "*the processing function of neocortical modules is qualitatively similar in all neocortical regions. Put shortly, there is nothing intrinsically motor about the motor cortex, nor sensory about the sensory cortex*". Mountcastle found that columns of neurons in the cortex behave similarly whether associated with vision, hearing or motor control. This has motivated arguments that we may only need one algorithm or model to build intelligence (Hawkins & Blakeslee, 2004).

Sensory substitution provides another argument for a single model (Bach-y Rita & Kercel, 2003). For example, it is possible to build tactile visual aids for blind people as follows. The signal captured by a camera can be sent via an electrode array on the tongue to the brain. The visual cortex learns to process and interpret these tactile signals, endowing the person with some form of "vision". Suggesting that, no matter the type of input signal, the same network can process it to useful effect.

Our work is based on deep autoregressive models, which have a long history and can be found in generative models of text, images, video and audio. Combining autoregressive generation with transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2018) has been of enormous impact in language modelling (Brown et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021), protein folding (Jumper et al., 2021), vision-language models (Tsimpoukelli et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021; Alayrac et al., 2022), code generation (Chen et al., 2021c; Li et al., 2022b), dialogue systems with retrieval capabilities (Nakano et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022), speech recognition (Pratap et al., 2020), neural machine translation (Johnson et al., 2019) and more (Bommasani et al., 2021). Recently researchers have explored task decomposition and grounding with language models (Huang et al., 2022; Ahn et al., 2022).

Li et al. (2022a) construct a control architecture, consisting of a sequence tokenizer, a pretrained language model and a task-specific feed-forward network. They apply it to VirtualHome and BabyAI tasks, and find that the inclusion of the pretrained language model improves generalisation to novel tasks. Similarly, Parisi et al. (2022) demonstrate that vision models pretrained with self-supervised learning, especially crop segmentations and momentum contrast (He et al., 2020), can be effectively incorporated into control policies.

As mentioned earlier, transfer in Atari is challenging. Rusu et al. (2016) researched transfer between randomly selected Atari games. They found that Atari is a difficult domain for transfer because of pronounced differences in the visuals, controls and strategy among the different games. Further difficulties that arise when applying behaviour cloning to video games like Atari are discussed by Kanervisto et al. (2020).

There has been great recent interest in data-driven robotics (Cabi et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2021a). However, Bommasani et al. (2021) note that in robotics "*the key stumbling block is collecting the right data. Unlike language and vision data, robotics data is neither plentiful nor representative of a sufficiently diverse array of embodiments, tasks, and environments*". Moreover, every time we update the hardware in a robotics lab, we need to collect new data and retrain. We argue that this is precisely why we need a generalist agent that can adapt to new embodiments and learn new tasks with few data.

Generating actions using an autoregressive model can lead to causal "self-delusion" biases when there are confounding variables (Ortega et al., 2021). For example, sampling actions can condition the model to solve the wrong task when multiple tasks share similar observation and actions specifications. As explained in Section 2, we use prompt engineering in ambiguous tasks, conditioning our model on a successful demonstration. This screens off confounding variables, reducing self-delusions. Another solution which we did not explore in this work is to use counterfactual teaching, where we train a model online using instantaneous expert feedback. We leave this for future investigation.

## **7 Broader Impact**

Although generalist agents are still only an emerging area of research, their potential impact on society calls for a thorough interdisciplinary analysis of their risks and benefits. For the sake of transparency, we document the intended use cases of Gato in the model card in Appendix A. However, the tools for mitigating harms of generalist agents are relatively underdeveloped, and require further research before these agents are deployed.

Since our generalist agent can act as a vision-language model, it inherits similar concerns as discussed in (Weidinger et al., 2021; Bommasani et al., 2021; Rae et al., 2021; Alayrac et al., 2022). In addition, generalist agents can take actions in the the physical world; posing new challenges that may require novel mitigation strategies. For example, physical embodiment could lead to users anthropomorphizing the agent, leading to misplaced trust in the case of a malfunctioning system, or be exploitable by bad actors. Additionally, while cross-domain knowledge transfer is often a goal in ML research, it could create unexpected and undesired outcomes if certain behaviors (e.g. arcade game fighting) are transferred to the wrong context. The ethics and safety considerations of knowledge transfer may require substantial new research as generalist systems advance.

Technical AGI safety (Bostrom, 2017) may also become more challenging when considering generalist agents that operate in many embodiments. For this reason, preference learning, uncertainty modeling and value alignment (Russell, 2019) are especially important for the design of human-compatible generalist agents. It may be possible to extend some of the value alignment approaches for language (Ouyang et al., 2022; Kenton et al., 2021) to generalist agents. However, even as technical solutions are developed for value alignment, generalist systems could still have negative societal impacts even with the intervention of wellintentioned designers, due to unforeseen circumstances or limited oversight (Amodei et al., 2016). This limitation underscores the need for a careful design and a deployment process that incorporates multiple disciplines and viewpoints.

Understanding how the models process information, and any emergent capabilities, requires significant experimentation. External retrieval (Borgeaud et al., 2021; Menick et al., 2022; Nakano et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022) has been shown to improve both interpretability and performance, and hence should be considered in future designs of generalist agents.

Although still at the proof-of-concept stage, the recent progress in generalist models suggests that safety researchers, ethicists, and most importantly, the general public, should consider their risks and benefits. We are not currently deploying Gato to any users, and so anticipate no immediate societal impact. However, given their potential impact, generalist models should be developed thoughtfully and deployed in a way that promotes the health and vitality of humanity.

## **8 Limitations and Future work**

## **8.1 RL data collection**

Gato is a data-driven approach, as it is derived from imitation learning. While natural language or image datasets are relatively easy to obtain from the web, a web-scale dataset for control tasks is not currently available. This may seem at first to be problematic, especially when scaling Gato to a higher number of parameters.

That being said, there has already been extensive investigation into this issue. Offline RL aims at leveraging existing control datasets, and its increasing popularity has already resulted in the availability of more diverse and larger datasets. Richer environments and simulations are being built (e.g. Metaverse), and increasing numbers of users already interact with them among thousands of already deployed online games (e.g. there exists a large dataset of Starcraft 2 games). Real-life data has also been already stored for ML research purposes; for example, data for training self-driving cars is acquired from recording human driver data. Finally, while Gato uses data consisting of both observations and corresponding actions, the possibility of using large scale observation-only data to enhance agents has been already studied (Baker et al., 2022). Thanks to online video sharing and streaming platforms such as Youtube and Twitch, observation-only datasets are not significantly more difficult to collect than natural language datasets, motivating a future research direction to extend Gato to learn from web data.

While the previous paragraph focuses on alleviating drawbacks of data collection from RL agents, it is important to note that this approach presents a different set of tradeoffs compared to scraping web data and can be actually more practical in some situations. Once the simulation is set up and near SOTA agent trained, it can be used to generate massive amounts of high quality data. That is in contrast to the quality of web data which is notorious for its low quality.

In short, we believe that acquiring suitable data is another research question on its own, and this is an active area of research with growing momentum and importance.

#### **8.2 Prompt and short context**

Gato is prompted with an expert demonstration, which aids the agent to output actions corresponding to the given task. This is particularly useful since there is otherwise no task identifier available to the agent (that is in contrast to many multi-task RL settings). Gato infers the relevant task from the observations and actions in the prompt.

However, the context length of our agent is limited to 1024 tokens which translates to the agent sometimes attending to only a few environment timesteps in total. This is especially the case for environments with image observations, where depending on the resolution each observation can result in more than one hundred tokens each. Hence for certain environments only a short chunk of a demonstration episode fits in the transformer memory.

Due to this limited prompt context, preliminary experiments with different prompt structures resulted in very similar performance. Similarly, early evaluations of the model using prompt-based in-context learning on new environments did not show a significant performance improvement compared to prompt-less evaluation in the same setting.

Context-length is therefore a current limitation of our architecture, mainly due to the quadratic scaling of self-attention. Many recently proposed architectures enable a longer context at greater efficiency and these innovations could potentially improve our agent performance. We hope to explore these architectures in future work.

## **9 Conclusions**

Transformer sequence models are effective as multi-task multi-embodiment policies, including for real-world text, vision and robotics tasks. They show promise as well in few-shot out-of-distribution task learning. In the future, such models could be used as a default starting point via prompting or fine-tuning to learn new behaviors, rather than training from scratch.

Given scaling law trends, the performance across all tasks including dialogue will increase with scale in parameters, data and compute. Better hardware and network architectures will allow training bigger models while maintaining real-time robot control capability. By scaling up and iterating on this same basic approach, we can build a useful general-purpose agent.

| Factors |  |

| Relevant Factors | Salient factors that may alter model performance are: agent embodi |
| --- | --- |
|  | ment in control data, training data token amount and diversity, per |
|  | formance of expert in training data and prompts (filtered by success |
|  | rate), and any factors inherited by vision & language datasets described |

|  | discussion of factors relating to training data diversity. |
| Evaluation Factors | Reported factors are: number of input tokens, proportion of data from |
|  | different domains, agent performance. Many relevant factors are left |
|  | for future work as use cases develop. |
|  | Metrics |
| Model Performance Measures | We chose to report episode return for our control tasks. We decided |
|  | not to report validation loss over held-out data because we found that |
|  | it did not correlate well with episode return on the held-out tasks. |
| Decision thresholds | N/A |

Approaches to Uncertainty and Variability The reported values do not take into consideration model uncertainty as they are evaluations of a single model. It is prohibitive for us to collect the full suite of results with multiple models, however we have not observed statistically significant variations between different models evaluated on subsets of our benchmarks. We account for environment noise in the control tasks we use for evaluation by averaging returns across multiple episodes. To reduce variance introduced when selecting datasets of the limited demonstrations used during fine-tuning we generate 3 independent sets of datasets. The model is fine-tuned separately on each set of datasets and we take the mean performance across all of them.

|  | Evaluation Data |
| --- | --- |
| Datasets | Gato is evaluated on in and out of distribution simulated control tasks, |
|  | see Section 4.1 and Section 5.2 for further details about these tasks. |
|  | We also evaluated on the Skill Generalization challenge from the RGB |
|  | Stacking robotics benchmark, see Section 4.2 and Section 5.3 for de |
|  | tails. |
| Motivation | We evaluated on the in-distribution simulated control and robotics |
|  | tasks to understand on how well Gato handles multi-modal and multi |
|  | task learning. We evaluated on out of distribution simulated control |
|  | and robotics tasks to understand how well Gato can adapt to entirely |
|  | new tasks. |
| Preprocessing | Observations from evaluation tasks are tokenized into a stream of dis |
|  | crete embeddings before being input to Gato. Section 2.1 and Sec |
|  | tion 2.2 go into details of how different modalities are tokenized and |
|  | combined. |

### **Training Data**

| --- | --- |
|  | include data from agent experience on both simulated and real world |
|  | environments, along with a variety of natural language and image |
|  | datasets. See Table 1 for details on our training datasets. |
| Motivation | To create a multi-modal, multi-task, multi-embodiment generalist pol |
|  | icy we collected as much, diverse, data as possible. Joint training on |
|  | all the datasets has produced a single network, Gato, which is capable |
|  | of playing Atari, captioning images, chat, stacking blocks with a real |
|  | robot arm, and more. See Section 3 for a more detailed discussion of |
|  | our training datasets. |

|  | Quantitative Analyses |
| Unitary Results | We present several evaluations of Gato against different benchmarks. |
|  | See Figure 5 for an analysis of Gato's performance on in distribution |
|  | control tasks. Sections 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4 analyze performance on out of |
|  | distribution control tasks. Finally, see Section 5.1 for a discussion on |
|  | how model scale affects in-distribution performance. |
|  | Ethical Considerations |
| Data | The vision and language datasets used include racist, sexist, and oth |
|  | erwise harmful context. |

| Risks and Harms | In addition to the potential harms of toxic image and language training data, Gato's real world embodiment introduces physical safety harms |
| --- | --- |
|  | due to misuse or malfunctioning. |
| Mitigations | No mitigation of bias introduced by vision and language data beyond |
|  | the filtering of sexually explicit content, as in Alayrac et al. (2022). |
|  | Physical risk is mitigated through safety measures implemented by |
|  | robotics environment designers. |
|  | Caveats and Recommendation |
| Future work | The interaction of diverse training data domains and the different affor |

dances faced in evaluation is poorly understood, and potential ethical and safety risks arise as the generalist's capabilities grow.

## **B Agent Data Tokenization Details**

In this section we provide additional details on our tokenization schemes. Our agent data is sequenced as follows:

- **Episodes** are presented to the agent in order of time (timesteps).
- **Timesteps** in turn are presented in the following order:
	- **Observations** ([y1:k, x1:m, z1:n]) are ordered lexicographically by key, each item is sequenced as follows:
		- ∗ Text tokens (y1:k) are in the same order as the raw input text.
		- ∗ Image patch tokens (x1:m) are in raster order.
		- ∗ Tensors (z1:n) (such as discrete and continuous observations) are in row-major order.
	- **Separator** ( 0 | 0 ); a designated separator token is provided after observations.
	- **Actions** (a1:A) are tokenized as discrete or continuous values and in row-major order.

A full sequence of tokens is thus given as the concatenation of data from T timesteps:

s1:L = [[y 1 1:k , x1 1:m, z1 1:n , 0 | 0 , a1 1:A]*, . . . ,* [y T 1:k , xT 1:m, zT 1:n , 0 | 0 , aT 1:A]],

where L = T(k + m + n + 1 + A) is the total number of tokens.

Each floating point element of tensors in the observation sequence is mu-law companded as in WaveNet (Oord et al., 2016):

$$F(x)=\mbox{sgn}(x)\frac{\log(|x|\mu+1.0)}{\log(M\mu+1.0)}\tag{3}$$

with parameters µ = 100 and M = 256. (If the floating-point tensor is in the action set, we do not need to compand the elements in the sequence because actions are only defined in the range [−1, 1] for all our environments.) All the elements are subsequently clipped so that they fall in the set [−1, 1]. Finally, they are discretized using bins of uniform width on the domain [−1, 1]. We use 1024 bins and shift the resulting integers so they are not overlapping with the ones used for text tokens. The tokenized result is therefore a sequence of integers within the range of [32000, 33024).

See Figure 14 and Figure 15 for visualizations of tokenizing and sequencing values (both discrete and continuous) and images. See Section C for details about local position encodings referenced in the figures.

Figure 16: **Architecture of the ResNet block used to convert tokenized image patches into token embeddings.** This block uses the v2 ResNet architecture (He et al., 2016b), GroupNorm (Wu & He, 2018) (instead of LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016)) normalization, and GELU (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) (instead of RELU) activation functions.

#### Table 5: **Gato transformer hyperparameters.**

The transformer hyperparameters of Gato are presented in Table 5. We also list the hyperparameters of smaller architecture variants used in Section 5.

## **C.2 Embedding Function**

The ResNet block uses the v2 architecture (He et al., 2016b), contains GroupNorm (Wu & He, 2018) with 32 groups instead of LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016), and GELU (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) activation functions instead of RELU. The block is diagrammed in Figure 16.

#### **C.3 Position Encodings**

After tokens are mapped into token embeddings, two position encodings are added to the token embeddings (when applicable) to provide temporal and spatial information to the model. These are described below.

![](_page_33_Figure_1.jpeg)

Figure 17: **Patch position encodings.** Calculating patch position encodings (red) within the global image (far left). The relative row and column positions (i.e. positions normalized between [0, 1]) are first discretized using uniform binning and used to index a learnable row and column position encoding. These two encodings are then added to the token embedding corresponding to the patch.

#### **Patch Position Encodings**

These position encodings convey information about a patch's global position within the image from which the patch was extracted. First, the relative row and column intervals of the patch are calculated by normalizing the patch's pixel intervals by the image resolution. The row and column normalized intervals are then quantized into a vocabulary size (we use 128) and are used to index a row and column table of learnable position encodings. The method in which the quantized row and column intervals are converted into indices depends on whether we are training or evaluating the model: during training a random index is uniformly sampled from the quantized interval, while during evaluation we deterministically take the (rounded) mean of the interval. Once row and column position encoding are retrieved from the embedding table, they are added onto the token embedding produced by the resnet embedding function, as described previously.

To more concretely demonstrate this process, we provide an example in Figure 17. We will follow the process with the patch highlighted in red on the left of the subfigure. The image is of resolution 80 × 64 and each patch is 16 × 16, meaning there are 5 × 4 = 20 patches total. The highlighted patch starts at pixel row interval [16, 32] and pixel column interval [32, 64]. Normalized, the row interval is therefore [0.25, 0.5] and the column interval is [0.4, 0.6]. We then separately quantize the intervals into 128 uniformly spaced bins, with the resulting quantized row interval being [32, 64] and the quantized column interval being [51, 77]. During training, we uniformly sample integers between the quantized row intervals, whereas during testing we would use the means, which are index 48 for row position and index 64 for column position. The row and column positions are finally used to index separate row and column position encoding tables to produce learnable embeddings which are added onto the corresponding patch token embedding.

#### **Local Observation Position Encodings**

The local observation position encoding adds positional information about where observation tokens are positioned within the local time-step they were an element of. First, we reiterate that, during tokenization, for each time-step all elements of the observation set are tokenized into sequences and concatenated into an observation sequence. Each token in this observation sequence is given an index which corresponds to the sequence order, i.e. the first token is 0 and the last is the length of the observation sequence minus one. After embedding, for any tokens that were a part of an observation set, the corresponding observation token

Figure 18: **Local position encodings.** An example demonstrating how local position encodings are defined within each time-step's observation and action token subsequences. Note that no position encodings are added to action tokens.

index is used to index an embedding table of learnable position encodings, with one embedding for every possible observation token index (in practice we simply set the table size to a large value like 512). The position encoding is then added onto the observation token embedding to produce the final token embedding. Note that all action tokens are given the same position encoding regardless of their position in the time-step sequence. We illustrate an example of this process in Figure 18.

# **D Pretraining Setup**

**Optimizer:** For all models we use the AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017) optimizer with a linear warmup and cosine schedule decay. The linear warmup lasts for 15, 000 steps, starting from a learning rate of 1e-7 and ending at a different maximum learning rate depending on the model (see Table 6). This learning rate is then cosine decayed by a factor 10x over 1,000,000 steps. The AdamW optimizer has parameters β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95 and = 1e-8. We use a batch size of 512 and a sequence length of 1024 tokens for all models.

**Regularization:** We train with an AdamW weight decay parameter of 0.1. Additionally, we use stochastic depth (Huang et al., 2016) during pretraining, where each of the transformer sub-layers (i.e. each Multi-Head Attention and Dense Feedforward layer) is skipped with a probability of 0.1.

| Hyperparameter | Gato 1.18B | 364M | 79M |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Maximum Learning Rate | 1e-4 | 2e-4 | 1e-4 |
| Minimum Learning Rate | 1e-5 | 2e-5 | 1e-5 |

| Table 6: Learning rate schedule hyperparameters for the different model scales. |
| --- |

## **E Fine-tuning Setup**

**Optimizer:** For all models we use the Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) optimizer with a constant learning rate of 1e-5. The Adam optimizer has parameters β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95 and = 1e-8. We use a batch size of 64 and a sequence length of 1024 tokens for all models. We train for 10,000 gradient steps.

**Regularization:** We use dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) with a rate of 0.1.

**Evaluation:** We evaluate agent every 100 learning steps. Each evaluation reports the average of 10 runs of a given checkpoint. The moving average of 5 such scores is computed (to gather 50 runs together). The final fine-tuning performance is defined as the maximum of these smoothed scores.

**Datasets:** We generated data for the fine-tuning tasks the same way we did for the other tasks (see Section 3.1 for details). Instead of using all the data for a fine-tuning task, we discarded all but 2000 best episodes (leading to the highest returns). The fine-tuning datasets were created in the following way. We randomly took 1000 episodes (out of 2000 preselected episodes), then a subset of 100 episodes from the selected episodes, then 10, 5, 3, and finally a single episode. We repeated this procedure 3 times to obtain 3 series of cascading subsets for each task. Each subset is used to conduct one fine-tuning experiment, and each is reported on our plots in Section 5.2 as a separate point.

**Task settings:** We have not altered any of the tasks and used their canonical versions. As 3 out of 4 tasks are open sourced, they do not need further explanation. For the fourth task, DMLab order_of_apples_forage_simple, the goal is to collect apples in the right order, green ones first followed by the gold one.

# **F Data Collection Details**

## **F.1 Atari**

We collect two separate sets of Atari environments. The first (that we refer to as ALE Atari) consists of 51 canonical games from the Arcade Learning Environment (Bellemare et al., 2013). The second (that we refer to as ALE Atari Extended) is a set of alternative games3 with their game mode and difficulty randomly set at the beginning of each episode.

For each environment in these sets we collect data by training a Muesli (Hessel et al., 2021) agent for 200M total environment steps. We record approximately 20,000 random episodes generated by the agent during training.

## **F.2 Sokoban**

Sokoban is a planning problem (Racanière et al., 2017), in which the agent has to push boxes to target locations. Some of the moves are irreversible and consequently mistakes can render the puzzle unsolvable. Planning ahead of time is therefore necessary to succeed at this puzzle. We use a Muesli (Hessel et al., 2021) agent to collect training data.

### **F.3 BabyAI**

BabyAI is a gridworld environment whose levels consist of instruction-following tasks that are described by a synthetic language. We generate data for these levels with the built-in BabyAI bot. The bot has access to extra information which is used to execute optimal solutions, see Section C in the appendix of (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018) for more details about the bot. We collect 100,000 episodes for each level.

## **F.4 DeepMind Control Suite**

The DeepMind Control Suite (Tunyasuvunakool et al., 2020; Tassa et al., 2018) is a set of physics-based simulation environments. For each task in the control suite we collect two disjoint sets of data, one using only state features and another using only pixels. We use a D4PG (Barth-Maron et al., 2018) agent to collect data from tasks with state features, and an MPO (Abdolmaleki et al., 2018) based agent to collect data using pixels.

We also collect data for randomized versions of the control suite tasks with a D4PG agent. These versions randomize the actuator gear, joint range, stiffness, and damping, and geom size and density. There are two difficulty settings for the randomized versions. The small setting scales values by a random number sampled from the union of intervals [0.9, 0.95] ∪ [1.05, 1.1]. The large setting scales values by a random number sampled from the union of intervals [0.6, 0.8] ∪ [1.2, 1.4].

#### **F.5 DeepMind Lab**

DeepMind Lab (Beattie et al., 2016) is a first-person 3D environment designed to teach agents 3D vision from raw pixel inputs with an egocentric viewpoint, navigation, and planning.

We trained an IMPALA (Espeholt et al., 2018) agent jointly on a set of 18 parent DM Lab levels that generate maps procedurally for each new episode. Data was collected by executing the agent on these 18 levels, as well as an additional set of 237 levels handcrafted to test a diverse set of skills.

The 18 parent levels are characterized by high diversity of generated maps. The difference between the levels is rooted in hyper-parameters used in a generation process. These hyper-parameters control high-level characteristics such as types of structures spawned, difficulty of language instructions, or presence of specific tools. The parent levels were developed to improve performance of RL agents trained online on them.

In contrast to the parent levels, each of the additional handcrafted 237 levels uses almost the same map, and the main differences between instances of the same level map are aesthetics such as colors of walls or lighting conditions. The maps are not procedurally generated and were designed to test a diverse set of skills such as walking up stairs or using specific tools. They are similar to levels presented in Figure 3, Figure 7 and Figure 8 in aforementioned paper by Beattie et al. (2016).

Additional information on the 18 parent levels (and their relation to the other levels) is presnted in details in the NeurIPS Workshop talk *A Methodology for RL Environment Research* by Daniel Tanis4 .

In total, we collected data for 255 levels from the DeepMind Lab (18 parent levels and 237 handcrafted levels), 254 of which were used while training Gato. The remaining level was used for out of distribution evaluation.

### **F.6 Procgen Benchmark**

Procgen (Cobbe et al., 2020) is a suite of 16 procedurally generated Atari-like environments, which was proposed to benchmark sample efficiency and generalization in reinforcement learning. Data collection was done while training a R2D2 (Kapturowski et al., 2018) agent on each of the environments. We used the hard difficulty setting for all environments except for maze and heist, which we set to easy.

#### **F.7 Modular RL**

Modular RL (Huang et al., 2020) is a collection of MuJoCo (Todorov et al., 2012) based continuous control environments, composed of three sets of variants of the OpenAI Gym (Brockman et al., 2016) Walker2d-v2, Humanoid-v2, and Hopper-v2. Each variant is a morphological modification of the original body: the set of

<sup>4</sup>Available at https://neurips.cc/virtual/2021/workshop/21865#wse-detail-22801.

morphologies is generated by enumerating all possible subsets of limbs, and keeping only those sets that a) contain the torso, and b) still form a connected graph. This results in a set of variants with different input and output sizes, as well as different dynamics than the original morphologies. We collected data by training a single morphology-specific D4PG agent on each variant for a total of 140M actor steps, this was done for 30 random seeds per variant.

## **F.8 DeepMind Manipulation Playground**

The DeepMind Manipulation Playground (Zolna et al., 2021) is a suite of MuJoCo based simulated robot tasks. We collect data for 4 of the Jaco tasks (box, stack banana, insertion, and slide) using a Critic-Regularized Regression (CRR) agent (Wang et al., 2020) trained from images on human demonstrations. The collected data includes the MuJoCo physics state, which is we use for training and evaluating Gato.

#### **F.9 Meta-World**

Meta-World (Yu et al., 2020) is a suite of environments5 for benchmarking meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning. We collect data from all train and test tasks in the MT50 mode by training a MPO agent (Abdolmaleki et al., 2018) with unlimited environment seeds and with access to state of the MuJoCo physics engine. The collected data also contains the MuJoCo physics engine state.

## **G Real robotics evaluation details**

In the real world, control is asynchronous; physics does not wait for computations to finish. Thus, inference latency is a concern for evaluating a large model for real world tasks. In robotics, a fast control rate is thought to be critical for reacting to dynamic phenomena. The robot setup for RGB stacking has a 20Hz control rate (0.05 second timestep) by design. In order to reach an acceptable margin of latency, we modified inference at evaluation time by shortening the context length to 1. We also implemented a parallel sampling scheme where all the action tokens are zeroed out in the input sequences during training so we can sample all tokens corresponding to a robot action in a single model inference step instead of autoregressively as it's done in other domains. We found that the 1.18B parameter model was able to run on the hardware accelerators in our robots (NVidia GeForce RTX 3090s), but still overran the 20Hz control rate by a small amount (~0.01 seconds).

We use the sparse reward function described in Lee et al. (2021) for data filtering. We only select trajectories with *final* task success; that is, a sparse reward of 1 on the final timestep.

## **H Skill Mastery architecture**

The numbers reported for the Skill Mastery benchmark were collected by executing a model zero-shot that used an earlier version of the Gato architecture. Instead of the ResNet patch embedding, a similar architecture using a local transformer was used to embed image patch tokens. The local position embeddings and patch position embeddings were not used. These changes were implemented and found to improve Gato's performance after the pretraining data was changed (as we decided to focus on Skill Generalization instead of Skill Mastery challenge), which is why they are presented as the final architecture of our full model.

<sup>5</sup>We used a version from July 23rd 2021, specifically the following version: https://github.com/rlworkgroup/metaworld/ commit/a0009ed9a208ff9864a5c1368c04c273bb20dd06.

## **I Additional robotics ablations**

We conducted a series of ablations in simulation to better understand the effect of diverse pretraining data in the robotics domain (see Figure 19). We included the same baselines as in Section 5.2, selecting the 364M parameter size variant, as well as an additional baseline trained with control suite data only. The DM Control-only agent is superior to the base Gato at zero-shot transfer and with a lot of fine-tuning data, suggesting that Gato may not be using the representations learned from the text-based datasets when adapting to robotics tasks. The same domain only agent performs the best overall, matching the CRR baseline at 1 fine-tuning episode and outperforming it with more data, suggesting that Gato at current scale can trade its generalization capacity for data-efficient and effective few-shot adaptation.

## **J Attention visualization**

To render the transformer attention weights, we retrieved the cross-attention logits, a tensor with dimension (*H, T, T*) where H is the number of heads and T is the number of tokens in a sequence. The (*h, i, j*)th entry of this matrix can be interpreted as the amount that head h attends to token j from token i. Due to Gato's image tokenization scheme, there are multiple tokens per timestep. Therefore to render the attention for a particular timestep, we took the sub-matrix that corresponds to that timestep. We then applied a softmax over the rows of this matrix to normalize the relevant values. Because we are only interested in attention to the previous tokens, we excluded the diagonal by setting it to negative infinity before softmax.

To measure the importance of each patch, we averaged the attention weights over the corresponding column. Because Gato uses a causal transformer, the attention matrix is lower triangular, so the mean was only considered over the sub-column below the diagonal of the matrix. This corresponds to the average attention paid to particular patch over a whole timestep.

Using this method, we found the attention maps at the first layer the transformer to be most interpretable, agreeing with the findings of Abnar & Zuidema (2020). Certain heads clearly track task-specific entities and regions of the image. Figure 20 shows the attention maps for manually selected heads at the first layer for several tasks.

## **Abstract**

We propose Dual PatchNorm: two Layer Normalization layers (LayerNorms), before and after the patch embedding layer in Vision Transformers. We demonstrate that Dual Patch-Norm outperforms the result of exhaustive search for alternative LayerNorm placement strategies in the Transformer block itself. In our experiments on image classification, contrastive learning, semantic segmentation and transfer on downstream classification datasets, incorporating this trivial modification, often leads to improved accuracy over well-tuned vanilla Vision Transformers and never hurts.

## **1 Introduction**

Layer Normalization (Ba et al., 2016) is key to Transformer's success in achieving both stable training and high performance across a range of tasks. Such normalization is also crucial in Vision Transformers (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2021) which closely follow the standard recipe of the original Transformer model.

Following the "pre-LN" strategy in Baevski & Auli (2019) and Xiong et al. (2020), ViTs place LayerNorms before the self-attention layer and MLP layer in each Transformer block. We explore the following question: Can we improve ViT models with a different LayerNorm ordering? First, across five ViT architectures on ImageNet-1k (Russakovsky et al., 2015), we demonstrate that an exhaustive search of LayerNorm placements between the components of a Transformer block does not improve classification accuracy. This indicates that the pre-LN strategy in ViT is close to optimal. Our observation also applies to other alternate LayerNorm placements: NormFormer (Shleifer et al., 2021) and Sub-LN (Wang et al., 2022), which in isolation, do not improve over strong ViT classification models.

Second, we make an intriguing observation: placing additional LayerNorms before and after the standard ViT-projection layer, which we call Dual PatchNorm (DPN), can improve significantly over well tuned vanilla ViT baselines. Our experiments on image classification across three different datasets with varying number of examples and contrastive learning, demonstrate the efficacy of DPN. Interestingly, our qualitative experiments show that the LayerNorm scale parameters upweight the pixels at the center and corners of each patch.

Dual PatchNorm consists of a 2 line change to the standard ViT-projection layer.

## **2 Related Work**

Kim et al. (2021) add a LayerNorm after the patch-embedding and show that this improves the robustness of ViT against corruptions on small-scale datasets. Xiao et al. (2021) replace the standard Transformer stem with a small number of stacked stride-two 3 × 3 convolutions with batch normalizations and show that this improves the sensitivity to optimization hyperparameters and final accuracy. Xu et al. (2019) analyze LayerNorm and show that the derivatives of mean and variance have a greater contribution to final performance as opposed to forward normalization. Beyer et al. (2022a) consider Image-LN and Patch-LN as alternative strategies to efficiently train a single model for different patch sizes. Wang et al. (2022) add extra LayerNorms before the final dense projection in the self-attention block and the non-linearity in the MLP block, with a different initialization strategy. Shleifer et al. (2021) propose extra LayerNorms after the final dense projection in the self-attention block instead with a LayerNorm after the non-linearity in the MLP block. Unlike previous work, we show that LayerNorms before and after the embedding layer provide consistent improvements on classification and contrastive learning tasks. An orthogonal line of work (Liu et al., 2021; d'Ascoli et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021) involves incorporating convolutional inductive biases to VisionTransformers. Here, we exclusively and extensively study LayerNorm placements of vanilla ViT.

## **3 Background**

#### **3.1 Patch Embedding Layer in Vision Transformer**

Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) consist of a patch embedding layer (PE) followed by a stack of Transformer blocks. The PE layer first rearranges the image x ∈ RH×W×3 into a sequence of patches xp ∈ R HW P 2 ×P 2 where P denotes the patch size. It then projects each patch independently with a dense projection to constitute a sequence of "visual tokens" xt ∈ R HW P 2 ×D P controls the trade-off between granularity of the visual tokens and the computational cost in the subsequent Transformer layers.

#### **3.2 Layer Normalization**

Given a sequence of N patches x ∈ RN×D, LayerNorm as applied in ViTs consist of two operations:

$${\bf x}=\frac{{\bf x}-\mu(x)}{\sigma(x)}\tag{1}$$

$${\bf y}=\gamma{\bf x}+\beta\tag{2}$$

where µ(x) ∈ RN , σ(x) ∈ RN , γ ∈ RD, β ∈ RD.

First, Eq. 1 normalizes each patch xi ∈ RD of the sequence to have zero mean and unit standard deviation. Then, Eq 2 applies learnable shifts and scales β and γ which are shared across all patches.

## **4 Methods**

### **4.1 Alternate LayerNorm placements:**

Following Baevski & Auli (2019) and Xiong et al. (2020), ViTs incorporate LayerNorm before every selfattention and MLP layer, commonly known as the pre-LN strategy. For each of the self-attention and MLP layer, we evaluate 3 strategies: place LayerNorm before (pre-LN), after (post-LN), before and after (pre+post-LN) leading to nine different combinations.

#### **4.2 Dual PatchNorm**

Instead of adding LayerNorms to the Transformer block, we also propose to apply LayerNorms in the stem alone, both before and after the patch embedding layer. In particular, we replace

$${\bf x}={\rm PE}({\bf x})\tag{3}$$

with

$\bf x=LN(PE(LN(x)))$

and keep the rest of the architecture fixed. We call this Dual PatchNorm (DPN).

## **5 Experiments on ImageNet Classification**

#### **5.1 Setup**

We adopt the standard formulation of Vision Transformers (Sec. 3.1) which has shown broad applicability across a number of vision tasks. We train ViT architectures (with and without DPN) in a supervised fashion on 3 different datasets with varying number of examples: ImageNet-1k (1M), ImageNet-21k (21M) and JFT (4B) (Zhai et al., 2022a). In our experiments, we apply DPN directly on top of the baseline ViT recipes without additional hyperparamter tuning. We split the ImageNet train set into a train and validation split, and use the validation split to arrive at the final DPN recipe.

**ImageNet 1k:** We train 5 architectures: Ti/16, S/16, S/32, B/16 and B/32 using the AugReg (Steiner et al., 2022) recipe for 93000 steps with a batch size of 4096 and report the accuracy on the official ImageNet validation split as is standard practice. The AugReg recipe provides the optimal mixup regularization (Zhang et al., 2017) and RandAugment (Cubuk et al., 2020) for each ViT backbone. Further, we evaluate a S/16 baseline (S/16+) with additional extensive hyperparameter tuning on ImageNet (Beyer et al., 2022b).Finally, we also apply DPN on top of the base and small DeiT variants (Touvron et al., 2021). Our full set of hyperparameters are available in Appendix C and Appendix D.

**ImageNet 21k:** We adopt a similar setup as in ImageNet 1k. We report ImageNet 25 shot accuracies in two training regimes: 93K and 930K steps.

**JFT:** We evaluate the ImageNet 25 shot accuracies of 3 variants (B/32, B/16 and L/16) on 2 training regimes: (220K and 1.1M steps) with a batch size of 4096. In this setup, we do not use any additional data augmentation or mixup regularization.

On ImageNet-1k, we report the 95% confidence interval across atleast 3 independent runs. On ImageNet-21k and JFT, because of expensive training runs, we train each model once and report the mean 25 shot accuracy with 95% confidence interval across 3 random seeds.

#### **5.2 DPN versus alternate LayerNorm placements**

Each Transformer block in ViT consists of a self-attention (SA) and MLP layer. Following the pre-LN strategy (Xiong et al., 2020), LN is inserted before both the SA and MLP layers. We first show that the default pre-LN strategy in ViT models is close to optimal by evaluating alternate LN placements on ImageNet-1k. We then contrast this with the performance of NormFormer, Sub-LN and DPN.

For each SA and MLP layer, we evaluate three LN placements: Pre, Post and Pre+Post, that leads to nine total LN placement configurations. Additionally, we evaluate the LayerNorm placements in NormFormer (Shleifer et al., 2021) and Sub LayerNorm (Wang et al., 2022) which add additional LayerNorms within each of the self-attention and MLP layers in the transformer block. Figure 1 shows that none of the placements outperform the default Pre-LN strategy significantly, indicating that the default pre-LN strategy is close to optimal. NormFormer provides some improvements on ViT models with a patch size of 32. DPN on the other-hand provides consistent improvements across all 5 architectures.

Figure 1: The plot displays the accuracy gains of different LayerNorm placement strategies over the default pre-LN strategy. Each blue point (**Other LN placement**) corresponds to a different LN placement in the Transformer block. None of the placements outperform the default Pre-LN strategy on ImageNet-1k (Russakovsky et al., 2015). Applying DPN (black cross) provides consistent improvements across all 5 architectures.

The table shows their ImageNet 25 shot accuracies with and without Dual PatchNorm

#### **5.3 Comparison to ViT**

In Table 1 left, DPN improved the accuracy of B/16, the best ViT model by 0.7 while S/32 obtains the maximum accuracy gain of 1.9. The average gain across all architecture is 1.4. On top of DeiT-S and DeiT-B, DPN provides an improvement of 0.3 and 0.2 respectively. Further, we finetune B/16 and B/32 models with and without DPN on high resolution ImageNet (384 × 384) for 5000 steps with a batch-size of 512 (See Appendix D for the full hyperparameter setting). Applying DPN improves high-res, finetuned B/16 and B/32 by 0.6 and 1.0 respectively.

DPN improves all architectures trained on ImageNet-21k (Table 1 Right) and JFT (Table 2) on shorter training regimes with average gains of 1.7 and 0.8 respectively. On longer training regimes, DPN improves the accuracy of the best-performing architectures on JFT and ImageNet-21k by 0.5 and 0.4 respectively.

In three cases, Ti/16 and S/32 with ImageNet-21k and B/16 with JFT, DPN matches or leads to marginally worse results than the baseline. Nevertheless, across a large fraction of ViT models, simply employing DPN out-of-the-box on top of well-tuned ViT baselines lead to significant improvements.

#### **5.4 Finetuning on ImageNet with DPN**

We finetune four models trained on JFT-4B with two resolutions on ImageNet-1k: (B/32, B/16) × (220K, 1.1M) steps on resolutions 224 × 224 and 384 × 384. On B/32 we observe a consistent improvement across all configurations. With L/16, DPN outperforms the baseline on 3 out of 4 configurations.

| Arch | Base | DPN | Arch | Resolution | Steps | Base | DPN |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 220K steps |  | B/32 | 224 | 220K | 77.6 ± 0.06 | 78.3 | ± 0.00 |
| B/32 | 63.8 ± 0.03 | 65.2 ± 0.03 | B/32 | 384 | 220K | 81.3 ± 0.09 | 81.6 | ± 0.00 |
| B/16 | 72.1 ± 0.09 | 72.4 ± 0.07 | B/32 | 224 | 1.1M | 80.8 ± 0.1 | 81.3 | ± 0.00 |

## **6 Experiments on Downstream Tasks**

#### **6.1 Finetuning on VTAB**

We finetune ImageNet-pretrained B/16 and B/32 with and without DPN on the Visual Task Adaption benchmark (VTAB) (Zhai et al., 2019). VTAB consists of 19 datasets: 7 Natural , 4 Specialized and 8 Structured . Natural consist of datasets with natural images captured with standard cameras, Specialized has images captured with specialized equipment and Structured require scene comprehension. We use the VTAB training protocol which defines a standard train split of 800 examples and a validation split of 200 examples per dataset. We perform a lightweight sweep across 3 learning rates on each dataset and use the mean validation accuracy across 3 seeds to pick the best model. Appendix E references the standard VTAB finetuning configuration. We then report the corresponding mean test score across 3 seeds in Table 3. In Table 3, accuracies within 95% confidence interval are not bolded.

On Natural , which has datasets closest to the source dataset ImageNet, B/32 and B/16 with DPN significantly outperform the baseline on 7 out of 7 and 6 out of 7 datasets respectively. Sun397 (Xiao et al., 2010) is the only dataset where applying DPN performs worse. In Appendix F, we additionally show that DPN helps when B/16 is trained from scratch on Sun397. Applying DPN on Structured improves accuracy on 4 out of 8 datasets and remains neutral on 2 on both B/16 and B/32. On Specialized , DPN improves on 1 out of 4 datasets, and is neutral on 2. To conclude, DPN offers the biggest improvements, when finetuned on Natural . On Structured and Specialized , DPN is a lightweight alternative, that can help or at least not hurt on a majority of datasets.

Table 3: We evaluate DPN on VTAB (Zhai et al., 2019). When finetuned on Natural , B/32 and B/16 with DPN significantly outperform the baseline on 7 out of 7 and 6 out of 7 datasets respectively. On Structured , DPN improves both B/16 and B/32 on 4 out of 8 datasets and remains neutral on 2. On Specialized , DPN improves on 1 out of 4 datasets, and is neutral on 2.

#### **6.2 Contrastive Learning**

We apply DPN on image-text contrastive learning (Radford et al., 2021). Each minibatch consists of a set of image and text pairs. We train a text and image encoder to map an image to its correct text over all other texts in a minibatch. Specifically, we adopt LiT (Zhai et al., 2022b), where we initialize and freeze the image encoder from a pretrained checkpoint and train the text encoder from scratch. To evaluate zero-shot ImageNet accuracy, we represent each ImageNet class by its text label, which the text encoder maps into a class embedding. For a given image embedding, the prediction is the class corresponding to the nearest class embedding.

We evalute 4 frozen image encoders: 2 architectures (B/32 and L/16) trained with 2 schedules (220K and 1.1M steps). We resue standard hyperparameters and train only the text encoder using a contrastive loss for 55000 steps with a batch-size of 16384. Table 4 shows that on B/32, DPN improves over the baselines on both the setups while on L/16 DPN provides improvement when the image encoder is trained with shorter training schedules.

#### **6.3 Semantic Segmentation**

We finetune ImageNet-pretrained B/16 with and without DPN on the ADE-20K 512×512 (Zhou et al., 2019) semantic segmentation task. Following Strudel et al. (2021), a single dense layer maps the ViT features into per-patch output logits. A bilinear upsampling layer then transforms the output distribution into the final high resolution 512×512 semantic segmentation output. We finetune the entire ViT backbone with standard

| Arch | Steps | Base |  | DPN |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B/32 | 220K | 61.9 | ± 0.12 | 63.0 | ± 0.09 |
| B/32 | 1.1M | 67.4 | ± 0.07 | 68.0 | ± 0.09 |
| L/16 | 220K | 75.0 | ± 0.11 | 75.4 | ± 0.00 |
| L/16 | 1.1M | 78.7 | ± 0.05 | 78.7 | ± 0.1 |

Table 4: Zero Shot ImageNet accuracy on the LiT (Zhai et al., 2022b) contrastive learning setup.

| Fraction of Train Data | 1/16 |  | 1/8 | 1/4 | 1/2 | 1 |

| B/16 | 27.3 ± 0.09 | 32.6 | ± 0.09 | 36.9 ± 0.13 | 40.8 ± 0.1 | 45.6 ± 0.08 |

Table 5: We finetune ImageNet pretrained B/16 models with and without DPN on the ADE20K Semantic Segmentation task, when a varying fraction of ADE20K training data is available. The table reports the mean IoU across ten random seeds. Applying DPN improves IoU across all settings.

per-pixel cross-entropy loss. Appendix G specifies the full set of finetuning hyperparameters. Table 5 reports the mean mIOU across 10 random seeds and on different fractions of training data. The improvement in IoU is consistent across all setups.

## **7 Ablations**

**Is normalizing both the inputs and outputs of the embedding layer optimal?** In Eq 4, DPN applies LN to both the inputs and outputs to the embedding layer. We assess three alternate strategies: Pre, **Post** and **Post PosEmb** (Radford et al., 2021). Pre applies LayerNorm only to the inputs, **Post** only to the outputs and **Post PosEmb** to the outputs after being summed with positional embeddings.

Table 6 displays the accuracy gains with two alternate strategies: Pre is unstable on B/32 leading to a significant drop in accuracy. Additionally, Pre obtains minor drops in accuracy on S/32 and Ti/16. **Post** and **Post PosEmb** achieve worse performance on smaller models B/32, S/32 and Ti/16. Our experiments show that applying LayerNorm to both inputs and outputs of the embedding layer is necessary to obtain consistent improvements in accuracy across all ViT variants.

|  | B/16 | S/16 | B/32 | S/32 | Ti/16 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pre | -0.1 | 0.0 | -2.6 | -0.2 | -0.3 |
| Post | 0.0 | -0.2 | -0.5 | -0.7 | -1.1 |
| Post PosEmb | 0.0 | -0.1 | -0.4 | -0.9 | -1.1 |
| Only learnable | -0.8 | -0.9 | -1.2 | -1.6 | -1.6 |
| RMSNorm | 0.0 | -0.1 | -0.4 | -0.5 | -1.7 |
| No learnable | -0.5 | 0.0 | -0.2 | -0.1 | -0.1 |

Table 6: Ablations of various components of DPN. **Pre:** LayerNorm only to the inputs of the embedding layer. **Post:** LayerNorm only to the outputs of the embedding layer. **No learnable:** Per-patch normalization without learnable LayerNorm parameters. **Only learnable:** Learnable scales and shifts without standardization.

**Normalization vs Learnable Parameters:** As seen in Sec. 3.2, LayerNorm constitutes a normalization operation followed by learnable scales and shifts. We also ablate the effect of each of these operations in DPN.

Applying only learnable scales and shifts without normalization leads to a significant decrease in accuracy across all architectures. (See: **Only learnable** in Table 6). Additionally, removing the learnable parameters leads to unstable training on B/16 (**No learnable** in Table 6). Finally, removing the centering and bias parameters as done in **RMSNorm** (Zhang & Sennrich, 2019), reduces the accuracy of B/32, S/32 and Ti/16. We conclude that while both normalization and learnable parameters contribute to the success of DPN, normalization has a higher impact.

## **8 Analysis**

#### **8.1 Gradient Norm Scale**

![](_page_7_Figure_4.jpeg)

Figure 2: Gradient Norms with and without DPN in B/16. **Left:** Gradient Norm vs Depth. **Right:** Gradient Norm of the embedding layer vs number of steps.

We report per-layer gradient norms with and without DPN on B/16. Fig. 2 (Left) plots the mean gradient norm of the last 1000 training steps as a function of depth with and without DPN. Interestingly, the gradient norm of the base ViT patch embedding (black) is disproportionately large compared to the other layers. Applying DPN (red), on the other hand, scales down the gradient norm of the embedding layer. Fig. 2 (Right) additionally shows that the gradient norm of the embedding layer is reduced not only before convergence but also throughout the course of training. This property is consistent across ViT architectures of different sizes (Appendix H).

#### **8.2 Visualizing Scale Parameters**

Note that the first LayerNorm in Eq. 4 is applied directly on patches, that is, to raw pixels. Thus, the learnable parameters (biases and scales) of the first LayerNorm can be visualized directly in pixel space. Fig. 3 shows the scales of our smallest model and largest model which are: Ti/16 trained on ImageNet for 90000 steps and L/16 trained on JFT for 1.1M steps respectively. Since the absolute magnitude of the scale parameters vary across the R, G and B channel, we visualize the scale separately for each channel. Interestingly, for both models the scale parameter increases the weight of the pixels in the center of the patch and at the corners.

## **9 Conclusion**

We propose a simple modification to vanilla ViT models and show its efficacy on classification, contrastive learning, semantic segmentation and transfer to small classification datasets.

## **A Initial Project Idea**

We arrived at the Dual PatchNorm solution because of another project that explored adding whitened (decorrelated) patches to ViT. Our initial prototype had a LayerNorm right after the decorrelated patches, to ensure that they are of an appropriate scale. This lead to improvements across multiple benchmarks, suggesting that whitened patches can improve image classification. We later found out via ablations, that just LayerNorm is sufficient at the inputs and adding whitened patches on their own could degrade performance. Our paper highlights the need for rigorous ablations of complicated algorithms to arrive at simpler solutions which can be equally or even more effective.

## **B Code**

We perform all our experiments in the big-vision (Beyer et al., 2022c) and Scenic (Dehghani et al., 2022) library. Since the first LayerNorm of DPN is directly applied on pixels, we replace the first convolution with a patchify operation implemented with the einops (Rogozhnikov, 2022) library and a dense projection.

High Resolution Finetuning

## **F SUN397: Train from scratch**

On Sun397, applying DPN improves ViT models trained from scratch. We first search for an optimal hyperparameter setting across 3 learning rates: 1e-3, 3e-4, 1e-4, 2 weight decays: 0.03, 0.1 and two dropout values: 0.0, 0.1. We then searched across 3 mixup values 0.0, 0.2 and 0.5 and 4 randaugment distortion magnitudes 0, 5, 10 and 15. We train the final config for 600 epochs.

|  | Base | DPN |  | Base | DPN |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 41.4 | 47.5 |  | 45.6 | 51.8 |
| + Augmentation | 48.3 | 50.7 | + Augmentation | 58.7 | 63.0 |
| + Train Longer | 52.5 | 56.0 | + Train Longer | 60.8 | 66.3 |

# The Llama 3 Herd of Models

Llama Team, AI @ Meta1

1A detailed contributor list can be found in the appendix of this paper.

Modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems are powered by foundation models. This paper presents a new set of foundation models, called Llama 3. It is a herd of language models that natively support multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is a dense Transformer with 405B parameters and a context window of up to 128K tokens. This paper presents an extensive empirical evaluation of Llama 3. We find that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language models such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. We publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and post-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and our Llama Guard 3 model for input and output safety. The paper also presents the results of experiments in which we integrate image, video, and speech capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach. We observe this approach performs competitively with the state-of-the-art on image, video, and speech recognition tasks. The resulting models are not yet being broadly released as they are still under development.

### 1 Introduction

Foundation models are general models of language, vision, speech, and/or other modalities that are designed to support a large variety of AI tasks. They form the basis of many modern AI systems.

The development of modern foundation models consists of two main stages: (1) a pre-training stage in which the model is trained at massive scale using straightforward tasks such as next-word prediction or captioning and (2) a post-training stage in which the model is tuned to follow instructions, align with human preferences, and improve specific capabilities (for example, coding and reasoning).

In this paper, we present a new set of foundation models for language, called Llama 3. The Llama 3 Herd of models natively supports multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is dense Transformer with 405B parameters, processing information in a context window of up to 128K tokens. Each member of the herd is listed in Table 1. All the results presented in this paper are for the Llama 3.1 models, which we will refer to as Llama 3 throughout for brevity.

We believe there are three key levers in the development of high-quality foundation models: data, scale, and managing complexity. We seek to optimize for these three levers in our development process:

- Data. Compared to prior versions of Llama (Touvron et al., 2023a,b), we improved both the quantity and quality of the data we use for pre-training and post-training. These improvements include the development of more careful pre-processing and curation pipelines for pre-training data and the development of more rigorous quality assurance and filtering approaches for post-training data. We pre-train Llama 3 on a corpus of about 15T multilingual tokens, compared to 1.8T tokens for Llama 2.
- Scale. We train a model at far larger scale than previous Llama models: our flagship language model was pre-trained using 3.8 × 1025 FLOPs, almost 50× more than the largest version of Llama 2. Specifically, we pre-trained a flagship model with 405B trainable parameters on 15.6T text tokens. As expected per

scaling laws for foundation models, our flagship model outperforms smaller models trained using the same procedure. While our scaling laws suggest our flagship model is an approximately compute-optimal size for our training budget, we also train our smaller models for much longer than is compute-optimal. The resulting models perform better than compute-optimal models at the same inference budget. We use the flagship model to further improve the quality of those smaller models during post-training.

- Managing complexity. We make design choices that seek to maximize our ability to scale the model development process. For example, we opt for a standard dense Transformer model architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) with minor adaptations, rather than for a mixture-of-experts model (Shazeer et al., 2017) to maximize training stability. Similarly, we adopt a relatively simple post-training procedure based on supervised finetuning (SFT), rejection sampling (RS), and direct preference optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al. (2023)) as opposed to more complex reinforcement learning algorithms (Ouyang et al., 2022; Schulman et al., 2017) that tend to be less stable and harder to scale.
The result of our work is Llama 3: a herd of three multilingual1 language models with 8B, 70B, and 405B parameters. We evaluate the performance of Llama 3 on a plethora of benchmark datasets that span a wide range of language understanding tasks. In addition, we perform extensive human evaluations that compare Llama 3 with competing models. An overview of the performance of the flagship Llama 3 model on key benchmarks is presented in Table 2. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our flagship model performs on par with leading language models such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023a) across a variety of tasks, and is close to matching the state-of-the-art. Our smaller models are best-in-class, outperforming alternative models with similar numbers of parameters (Bai et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). Llama 3 also delivers a much better balance between helpfulness and harmlessness than its predecessor (Touvron et al., 2023b). We present a detailed analysis of the safety of Llama 3 in Section 5.4.

We are publicly releasing all three Llama 3 models under an updated version of the Llama 3 Community License; see https://llama.meta.com. This includes pre-trained and post-trained versions of our 405B parameter language model and a new version of our Llama Guard model (Inan et al., 2023) for input and output safety. We hope that the open release of a flagship model will spur a wave of innovation in the research community, and accelerate a responsible path towards the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI).

As part of the Llama 3 development process we also develop multimodal extensions to the models, enabling image recognition, video recognition, and speech understanding capabilities. These models are still under active development and not yet ready for release. In addition to our language modeling results, the paper presents results of our initial experiments with those multimodal models.

### 2 General Overview

The model architecture of Llama 3 is illustrated in Figure 1. The development of our Llama 3 language models comprises two main stages:

- Language model pre-training. We start by converting a large, multilingual text corpus to discrete tokens and pre-training a large language model (LLM) on the resulting data to perform next-token prediction. In the language model pre-training stage, the model learns the structure of language and obtains large amounts of knowledge about the world from the text it is "reading". To do this effectively, pre-training is performed at massive scale: we pre-train a model with 405B parameters on 15.6T tokens using a context window of 8K tokens. This standard pre-training stage is followed by a continued pre-training stage that increases the supported context window to 128K tokens. See Section 3 for details.
- Language model post-training. The pre-trained language model has a rich understanding of language but it does not yet follow instructions or behave in the way we would expect an assistant to. We align the model with human feedback in several rounds, each of which involves supervised finetuning (SFT) on instruction tuning data and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2024). At this post-training2 stage, we also integrate new capabilities, such as tool-use, and observe strong improvements in other areas, such as coding and reasoning. See Section 4 for details. Finally, safety mitigations are also incorporated into the model at the post-training stage, the details of which are described in Section 5.4.

The resulting models have a rich set of capabilities. They can answer questions in at least eight languages, write high-quality code, solve complex reasoning problems, and use tools out-of-the-box or in a zero-shot way.

We also perform experiments in which we add image, video, and speech capabilities to Llama 3 using a compositional approach. The approach we study comprises the three additional stages illustrated in Figure 28:

- Multi-modal encoder pre-training. We train separate encoders for images and speech. We train our image encoder on large amounts of image-text pairs. This teaches the model the relation between visual content and the description of that content in natural language. Our speech encoder is trained using a
<sup>2</sup> In this paper, we use the term "post-training" to refer to any model training that happens outside of pre-training.

self-supervised approach that masks out parts of the speech inputs and tries to reconstruct the masked out parts via a discrete-token representation. As a result, the model learns the structure of speech signals. See Section 7 for details on the image encoder and Section 8 for details on the speech encoder.

- Vision adapter training. We train an adapter that integrates the pre-trained image encoder into the pre-trained language model. The adapter consists of a series of cross-attention layers that feed imageencoder representations into the language model. The adapter is trained on text-image pairs. This aligns the image representations with the language representations. During adapter training, we also update the parameters of the image encoder but we intentionally do not update the language-model parameters. We also train a video adapter on top of the image adapter on paired video-text data. This enables the model to aggregate information across frames. See Section 7 for details.
- Speech adapter training. Finally, we integrate the speech encoder into the model via an adapter that converts speech encodings into token representations that can be fed directly into the finetuned language model. The parameters of the adapter and encoder are jointly updated in a supervised finetuning stage to enable high-quality speech understanding. We do not change the language model during speech adapter training. We also integrate a text-to-speech system. See Section 8 for details.

Our multimodal experiments lead to models that can recognize the content of images and videos, and support interaction via a speech interface. These models are still under development and not yet ready for release.

### 3 Pre-Training

Language model pre-training involves: (1) the curation and filtering of a large-scale training corpus, (2) the development of a model architecture and corresponding scaling laws for determining model size, (3) the development of techniques for efficient pre-training at large scale, and (4) the development of a pre-training recipe. We present each of these components separately below.

#### 3.1 Pre-Training Data

We create our dataset for language model pre-training from a variety of data sources containing knowledge until the end of 2023. We apply several de-duplication methods and data cleaning mechanisms on each data source to obtain high-quality tokens. We remove domains that contain large amounts of personally identifiable information (PII), and domains with known adult content.

#### 3.1.1 Web Data Curation

Much of the data we utilize is obtained from the web and we describe our cleaning process below.

PII and safety filtering. Among other mitigations, we implement filters designed to remove data from websites are likely to contain unsafe content or high volumes of PII, domains that have been ranked as harmful according to a variety of Meta safety standards, and domains that are known to contain adult content.

Text extraction and cleaning. We process the raw HTML content for non-truncated web documents to extract high-quality diverse text. To do so, we build a custom parser that extracts the HTML content and optimizes for precision in boilerplate removal and content recall. We evaluate our parser's quality in human evaluations, comparing it with popular third-party HTML parsers that optimize for article-like content, and found it to perform favorably. We carefully process HTML pages with mathematics and code content to preserve the structure of that content. We maintain the image alt attribute text since mathematical content is often represented as pre-rendered images where the math is also provided in the alt attribute. We experimentally evaluate different cleaning configurations. We find markdown is harmful to the performance of a model that is primarily trained on web data compared to plain text, so we remove all markdown markers.

De-duplication. We apply several rounds of de-duplication at the URL, document, and line level:

- URL-level de-duplication. We perform URL-level de-duplication across the entire dataset. We keep the most recent version for pages corresponding to each URL.
- Document-level de-duplication. We perform global MinHash (Broder, 1997) de-duplication across the entire dataset to remove near duplicate documents.
- Line-level de-duplication. We perform aggressive line-level de-duplication similar to ccNet (Wenzek et al., 2019). We remove lines that appeared more than 6 times in each bucket of 30M documents. Although our manual qualitative analysis showed that the line-level de-duplication removes not only leftover boilerplate from various websites such as navigation menus, cookie warnings, but also frequent high-quality text, our empirical evaluations showed strong improvements.

Heuristic filtering. We develop heuristics to remove additional low-quality documents, outliers, and documents with excessive repetitions. Some examples of heuristics include:

- We use duplicated n-gram coverage ratio (Rae et al., 2021) to remove lines that consist of repeated content such as logging or error messages. Those lines could be very long and unique, hence cannot be filtered by line-dedup.
- We use "dirty word" counting (Raffel et al., 2020) to filter out adult websites that are not covered by domain block lists.
- We use a token-distribution Kullback-Leibler divergence to filter out documents containing excessive numbers of outlier tokens compared to the training corpus distribution.

Model-based quality filtering. Further, we experiment with applying various model-based quality classifiers to sub-select high-quality tokens. These include using fast classifiers such as fasttext (Joulin et al., 2017) trained to recognize if a given text would be referenced by Wikipedia (Touvron et al., 2023a), as well as more compute-intensive Roberta-based classifiers (Liu et al., 2019a) trained on Llama 2 predictions. To train a quality classifier based on Llama 2, we create a training set of cleaned web documents, describe the quality requirements, and instruct Llama 2's chat model to determine if the documents meets these requirements. We use DistilRoberta (Sanh et al., 2019) to generate quality scores for each document for efficiency reasons. We experimentally evaluate the efficacy of various quality filtering configurations.

Code and reasoning data. Similar to DeepSeek-AI et al. (2024), we build domain-specific pipelines that extract code and math-relevant web pages. Specifically, both the code and reasoning classifiers are DistilRoberta models trained on web data annotated by Llama 2. Unlike the general quality classifier mentioned above, we conduct prompt tuning to target web pages containing math deduction, reasoning in STEM areas and code interleaved with natural language. Since the token distribution of code and math is substantially different than that of natural language, these pipelines implement domain-specific HTML extraction, customized text features and heuristics for filtering.

Multilingual data. Similar to our processing pipelines for English described above, we implement filters to remove data from websites that are likely to contain PII or unsafe content. Our multilingual text processing pipeline has several unique features:

- We use a fasttext-based language identification model to categorize documents into 176 languages.
- We perform document-level and line-level de-duplication within data for each language.

- We apply language-specific heuristics and model-based filters to remove low-quality documents.
In addition, we perform quality ranking of multilingual documents using a multilingual Llama 2-based classifier to ensure that high-quality content is prioritized. We determine the amount of multilingual tokens used in pre-training experimentally, balancing model performance on English and multilingual benchmarks.

#### 3.1.2 Determining the Data Mix

To obtain a high-quality language model, it is essential to carefully determine the proportion of different data sources in the pre-training data mix. Our main tools in determining this data mix are knowledge classification and scaling law experiments.

Knowledge classification. We develop a classifier to categorize the types of information contained in our web data to more effectively determine a data mix. We use this classifier to downsample data categories that are over-represented on the web, for example, arts and entertainment.

Scaling laws for data mix. To determine the best data mix, we perform scaling law experiments in which we train several small models on a data mix and use that to predict the performance of a large model on that mix (see Section 3.2.1). We repeat this process multiple times for different data mixes to select a new data mix candidate. Subsequently, we train a larger model on this candidate data mix and evaluate the performance of that model on several key benchmarks.

Data mix summary. Our final data mix contains roughly 50% of tokens corresponding to general knowledge, 25% of mathematical and reasoning tokens, 17% code tokens, and 8% multilingual tokens.

#### 3.1.3 Annealing Data

Empirically, we find that annealing (see Section 3.4.3) on small amounts of high-quality code and mathematical data can boost the performance of pre-trained models on key benchmarks. Akin to Li et al. (2024b), we perform annealing with a data mix that upsamples high-quality data in select domains. We do not include any training sets from commonly used benchmarks in our annealing data. This enables us to assess the true few-shot learning capabilities and out-of-domain generalization of Llama 3.

Following OpenAI (2023a), we evaluate the efficacy of annealing on the GSM8k (Cobbe et al., 2021) and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b) training sets in annealing. We find that annealing improved the performance of a pre-trained Llama 3 8B model on the GSM8k and MATH validation sets by 24.0% and 6.4%, respectively. However, the improvements on the 405B model are negligible, suggesting that our flagship model has strong in-context learning and reasoning capabilities and does not require specific in-domain training samples to obtain strong performance.

Using annealing to assess data quality. Similar to Blakeney et al. (2024), we find that annealing enables us to judge the value of small domain-specific datasets. We measure the value of such datasets by annealing the learning rate of a 50% trained Llama 3 8B model linearly to 0 on 40B tokens. In those experiments, we assign 30% weight to the new dataset and the remaining 70% weight to the default data mix. Using annealing to evaluate new data sources is more efficient than performing scaling law experiments for every small dataset.

### 3.2 Model Architecture

Llama 3 uses a standard, dense Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). It does not deviate significantly from Llama and Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023a,b) in terms of model architecture; our performance gains are primarily driven by improvements in data quality and diversity as well as by increased training scale.

We make a few small modifications compared to Llama 2:

- We use grouped query attention (GQA; Ainslie et al. (2023)) with 8 key-value heads to improve inference speed and to reduce the size of key-value caches during decoding.
- We use an attention mask that prevents self-attention between different documents within the same sequence. We find that this change had limited impact during in standard pre-training, but find it to be important in continued pre-training on very long sequences.

Table 3 Overview of the key hyperparameters of Llama 3. We display settings for 8B, 70B, and 405B language models.

- We use a vocabulary with 128K tokens. Our token vocabulary combines 100K tokens from the tiktoken3 tokenizer with 28K additional tokens to better support non-English languages. Compared to the Llama 2 tokenizer, our new tokenizer improves compression rates on a sample of English data from 3.17 to 3.94 characters per token. This enables the model to "read" more text for the same amount of training compute. We also found that adding 28K tokens from select non-English languages improved both compression ratios and downstream performance, with no impact on English tokenization.
- We increase the RoPE base frequency hyperparameter to 500,000. This enables us to better support longer contexts; Xiong et al. (2023) showed this value to be effective for context lengths up to 32,768.

Llama 3 405B uses an architecture with 126 layers, a token representation dimension of 16,384, and 128 attention heads; see Table 3 for details. This leads to a model size that is approximately compute-optimal according to scaling laws on our data for our training budget of 3.8 × 1025 FLOPs.

#### 3.2.1 Scaling Laws

We develop scaling laws (Hoffmann et al., 2022; Kaplan et al., 2020) to determine the optimal model size for our flagship model given our pre-training compute budget. In addition to determining the optimal model size, a major challenge is to forecast the flagship model's performance on downstream benchmark tasks, due to a couple of issues: (1) Existing scaling laws typically predict only next-token prediction loss rather than specific benchmark performance. (2) Scaling laws can be noisy and unreliable because they are developed based on pre-training runs conducted with small compute budgets (Wei et al., 2022b).

To address these challenges, we implement a two-stage methodology to develop scaling laws that accurately predict downstream benchmark performance:

- 1. We first establish a correlation between the compute-optimal model's negative log-likelihood on downstream tasks and the training FLOPs.
- 2. Next, we correlate the negative log-likelihood on downstream tasks with task accuracy, utilizing both the scaling law models and older models trained with higher compute FLOPs. In this step, we specifically leverage the Llama 2 family of models.

This approach enables us to predict downstream task performance given a specific number of training FLOPs for compute-optimal models. We use a similar method to select our pre-training data mix (see Section 3.4).

Scaling law experiments. Concretely, we construct our scaling laws by pre-training models using compute budgets between 6 × 1018 FLOPs and 1022 FLOPs. At each compute budget, we pre-train models ranging in size between 40M and 16B parameters, using a subset of model sizes at each compute budget. In these training runs, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with a linear warmup for 2,000 training steps. The peak learning rate is set between 2 × 10−4 and 4 × 10−4 depending on the size of the model. We set the cosine decay to 0.1 of the peak value. The weight decay at each step is set to 0.1 times the learning rate at that step. We use a fixed batch size for each compute scale, ranging between 250K and 4M.

![](_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg)

Figure 3 Number of training tokens in identified computeoptimal models as a function of pre-training compute budget. We include the fitted scaling-law prediction as well. The compute-optimal models correspond to the parabola minimums in Figure 2.

These experiments give rise to the IsoFLOPs curves in Figure 2. The loss in these curves is measured on a separate validation set. We fit the measured loss values using a second-degree polynomial and identify the minimums of each parabola. We refer to minimum of a parabola as the compute-optimal model at the corresponding pre-training compute budget.

We use the compute-optimal models we identified this way to predict the optimal number of training tokens for a specific compute budget. To do so, we assume a power-law relation between compute budget, C, and the optimal number of training tokens, N⋆ (C):

$$N^{\star}(C)=A C^{\alpha}.$$

We fit A and α using the data from Figure 2. We find that (α, A) = (0.53, 0.29); the corresponding fit is shown in Figure 3. Extrapolation of the resulting scaling law to 3.8 × 1025 FLOPs suggests training a 402B parameter model on 16.55T tokens.

An important observation is that IsoFLOPs curves become flatter around the minimum as the compute budget increases. This implies that performance of the flagship model is relatively robust to small changes in the trade-off between model size and training tokens. Based on this observation, we ultimately decided to train a flagship model with 405B parameters.

Predicting performance on downstream tasks. We use the resulting compute-optimal models to forecast the performance of the flagship Llama 3 model on benchmark data sets. First, we linearly correlate the (normalized) negative log-likelihood of correct answer in the benchmark and the training FLOPs. In this analysis, we use only the scaling law models trained up to 1022 FLOPs on the data mix described above. Next, we establish a sigmoidal relation between the log-likelihood and accuracy using both the scaling law models and Llama 2 models, which were trained using the Llama 2 data mix and tokenizer. We show the results of this experiment on the ARC Challenge benchmark in Figure 4). We find this two-step scaling law prediction, which extrapolates over four orders of magnitude, to be quite accurate: it only slightly underestimates the final performance of the flagship Llama 3 model.

#### 3.3 Infrastructure, Scaling, and Efficiency

We describe our hardware and infrastructure that powered Llama 3 405B pre-training at scale and discuss several optimizations that leads to improvements in training efficiency.

#### 3.3.1 Training Infrastructure

The Llama 1 and 2 models were trained on Meta's AI Research SuperCluster (Lee and Sengupta, 2022). As we scaled further, the training for Llama 3 was migrated to Meta's production clusters (Lee et al., 2024).This

Right: ARC Challenge benchmark accuracy as a function of the normalized negative log-likelihood of the correct answer. This analysis enables us to predict model performance on the ARC Challenge benchmark before pre-training commences. See text for details.

setup optimizes for production-grade reliability, which is essential as we scale up training.

Compute. Llama 3 405B is trained on up to 16K H100 GPUs, each running at 700W TDP with 80GB HBM3, using Meta's Grand Teton AI server platform (Matt Bowman, 2022). Each server is equipped with eight GPUs and two CPUs. Within a server, the eight GPUs are connected via NVLink. Training jobs are scheduled using MAST (Choudhury et al., 2024), Meta's global-scale training scheduler.

Storage. Tectonic (Pan et al., 2021), Meta's general-purpose distributed file system, is used to build a storage fabric (Battey and Gupta, 2024) for Llama 3 pre-training. It offers 240 PB of storage out of 7,500 servers equipped with SSDs, and supports a sustainable throughput of 2 TB/s and a peak throughput of 7 TB/s. A major challenge is supporting the highly bursty checkpoint writes that saturate the storage fabric for short durations. Checkpointing saves each GPU's model state, ranging from 1 MB to 4 GB per GPU, for recovery and debugging. We aim to minimize GPU pause time during checkpointing and increase checkpoint frequency to reduce the amount of lost work after a recovery.

Network. Llama 3 405B used RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) fabric based on the Arista 7800 and Minipack2 Open Compute Project4 OCP rack switches. Smaller models in the Llama 3 family were trained using Nvidia Quantum2 Infiniband fabric. Both RoCE and Infiniband clusters leverage 400 Gbps interconnects between GPUs. Despite the underlying network technology differences between these clusters, we tune both of them to provide equivalent performance for these large training workloads. We elaborate further on our RoCE network since we fully own its design.

- Network topology. Our RoCE-based AI cluster comprises 24K GPUs5 connected by a three-layer Clos network (Lee et al., 2024). At the bottom layer, each rack hosts 16 GPUs split between two servers and connected by a single Minipack2 top-of-the-rack (ToR) switch. In the middle layer, 192 such racks are connected by Cluster Switches to form a pod of 3,072 GPUs with full bisection bandwidth, ensuring no oversubscription. At the top layer, eight such pods within the same datacenter building are connected via Aggregation Switches to form a cluster of 24K GPUs. However, network connectivity at the aggregation layer does not maintain full bisection bandwidth and instead has an oversubscription ratio of 1:7. Our model parallelism methods (see Section 3.3.2) and training job scheduler (Choudhury et al., 2024) are all optimized to be aware of network topology, aiming to minimize network communication across pods.
- Load balancing. LLM training produces fat network flows that are hard to load balance across all available network paths using traditional methods such as Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing. To address this challenge, we employ two techniques. First, our collective library creates 16 network flows between two GPUs, instead of just one, thereby reducing the traffic per flow and providing more flows

<sup>4</sup>Open Compute Project: https://www.opencompute.org/

<sup>5</sup>Note that we use only up to 16K of these 24K GPUs for Llama 3 pre-training.

for load balancing. Second, our Enhanced-ECMP (E-ECMP) protocol effectively balances these 16 flows across different network paths by hashing on additional fields in the RoCE header of packets.

- Congestion control. We use deep-buffer switches in the spine (Gangidi et al., 2024) to accommodate transient congestion and buffering caused by collective communication patterns. This setup helps limit the impact of persistent congestion and network back pressure caused by slow servers, which is common in training. Finally, better load balancing through E-ECMP significantly reduces the chance of congestion. With these optimizations, we successfully run a 24K GPU cluster without traditional congestion control methods such as Data Center Quantized Congestion Notification (DCQCN).
#### 3.3.2 Parallelism for Model Scaling

To scale training for our largest models, we use 4D parallelism—a combination of four different types of parallelism methods—to shard the model. This approach efficiently distributes computation across many GPUs and ensures each GPU's model parameters, optimizer states, gradients, and activations fit in its HBM. Our implementation of 4D parallelism is illustrated in Figure 5. It combines tensor parallelism (TP; Krizhevsky et al. (2012); Shoeybi et al. (2019); Korthikanti et al. (2023)), pipeline parallelism (PP; Huang et al. (2019); Narayanan et al. (2021); Lamy-Poirier (2023)), context parallelism (CP; Liu et al. (2023a)), and data parallelism (DP; Rajbhandari et al. (2020); Ren et al. (2021); Zhao et al. (2023b)).

Tensor parallelism splits individual weight tensors into multiple chunks on different devices. Pipeline parallelism partitions the model vertically into stages by layers, so that different devices can process in parallel different stages of the full model pipeline. Context parallelism divides the input context into segments, reducing memory bottleneck for very long sequence length inputs. We use fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP; Rajbhandari et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2023b), which shards the model, optimizer, and gradients while implementing data parallelism which processes data in parallel on multiple GPUs and synchronizes after each training step. Our use of FSDP for Llama 3 shards optimizer states and gradients, but for model shards we do not reshard after forward computation to avoid an extra all-gather communication during backward passes.

GPU utilization. Through careful tuning of the parallelism configuration, hardware, and software, we achieve an overall BF16 Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU; Chowdhery et al. (2023)) of 38-43% for the configurations shown in Table 4. The slight drop in MFU to 41% on 16K GPUs with DP=128 compared to 43% on 8K GPUs with DP=64 is due to the lower batch size per DP group needed to keep the global tokens per batch constant during training.

Pipeline parallelism improvements. We encountered several challenges with existing implementations:

- Batch size constraint. Current implementations have constraints on supported batch size per GPU, requiring it to be divisible by the number of pipeline stages. For the example in Figure 6, the depth-first schedule (DFS) of pipeline parallelism (Narayanan et al., 2021) requires N = PP = 4, while the breadth-first schedule (BFS; Lamy-Poirier (2023)) requires N = M, where M is the total number of micro-batches and N is the number of contiguous micro-batches for the same stage's forward or backward. However, pre-training often needs flexibility to adjust batch size.
- Memory imbalance. Existing pipeline parallelism implementations lead to imbalanced resource consumption. The first stage consumes more memory due to the embedding and the warm-up micro-batches.
- Computation imbalance. After the last layer of the model, we need to calculate output and loss, making this stage the execution latency bottleneck.

![](_page_10_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 5 Illustration of 4D parallelism. GPUs are divided into parallelism groups in the order of [TP, CP, PP, DP], where DP stands for FSDP. In this example, 16 GPUs are configured with a group size of |TP|=2, |CP|=2, |PP|=2, and |DP|=2. A GPU's position in 4D parallelism is represented as a vector, [D1, D2, D3, D4], where Di is the index on the i-th parallelism dimension. In this example, GPU0[TP0, CP0, PP0, DP0] and GPU1[TP1, CP0, PP0, DP0] are in the same TP group, GPU0 and GPU2 are in the same CP group, GPU0 and GPU4 are in the same PP group, and GPU0 and GPU8 are in the same DP group.

To address these issues, we modify our pipeline schedule as shown in Figure 6, which allows setting N flexibly—in this case N = 5, which can run a arbitrary number of micro-batches in each batch. This allows us to run: (1) fewer micro-batches than the number of stages when we have batch size limit at large scale; or (2) more micro-batches to hide point-to-point communication, finding a sweet spot between DFS and breadth first schedule (BFS) for the best communication and memory efficiency. To balance the pipeline, we reduce one Transformer layer each from the first and the last stages, respectively. This means that the first model chunk on the first stage has only the embedding, and the last model chunk on the last stage has only output projection and loss calculation. To reduce pipeline bubbles, we use an interleaved schedule (Narayanan et al., 2021) with V pipeline stages on one pipeline rank. Overall pipeline bubble ratio is PP−1 V ∗M . Further, we adopt asynchronous point-to-point communication in PP, which considerably speeds up training, especially in cases when the document mask introduces extra computation imbalance. We enable TORCH_NCCL_AVOID_RECORD_STREAMS to reduce memory usage from asynchronous point-to-point communication. Finally, to reduce memory cost, based on detailed memory allocation profiling, we proactively deallocate tensors that will not be used for future computation, including the input and output tensors of each pipeline stage, that will not be used for future computation. With these optimizations, we could pre-train Llama 3 on sequences of 8K tokens without activation checkpointing.

Context parallelism for long sequences. We utilize context parallelism (CP) to improve memory efficiency when scaling the context length of Llama 3 and enable training on extremely long sequences up to 128K in length. In CP, we partition across the sequence dimension, and specifically we partition the input sequence into 2 × CP chunks so each CP rank receives two chunks for better load balancing. The i-th CP rank received both the i-th and the (2 × CP − 1 − i)-th chunks.

Different from existing CP implementations that overlap communication and computation in a ring-like structure (Liu et al., 2023a), our CP implementation adopts an all-gather based method where we first all-gather the key (K) and value (V) tensors, and then compute attention output for the local query (Q) tensor chunk. Although the all-gather communication latency is exposed in the critical path, we still adopt this approach for two main reasons: (1) it is easier and more flexible to support different types of attention masks in all-gather based CP attention, such as the document mask; and (2) the exposed all-gather latency

Figure 6 Illustration of pipeline parallelism in Llama 3. Pipeline parallelism partitions eight pipeline stages (0 to 7) across four pipeline ranks (PP ranks 0 to 3), where the GPUs with rank 0 run stages 0 and 4, the GPUs with P rank 1 run stages 1 and 5, etc. The colored blocks (0 to 9) represent a sequence of micro-batches, where M is the total number of micro-batches and N is the number of continuous micro-batches for the same stage's forward or backward. Our key insight is to make N tunable.

is small as the communicated K and V tensors are much smaller than Q tensor due to the use of GQA (Ainslie et al., 2023). Hence, the time complexity of attention computation is an order of magnitude larger than all-gather (O(S 2 ) versus O(S), where S represents the sequence length in the full causal mask), making the all-gather overhead negligible.

Network-aware parallelism configuration. The order of parallelism dimensions, [TP, CP, PP, DP], is optimized for network communication. The innermost parallelism requires the highest network bandwidth and lowest latency, and hence is usually constrained to within the same server. The outermost parallelism may spread across a multi-hop network and should tolerate higher network latency. Therefore, based on the requirements for network bandwidth and latency, we place parallelism dimensions in the order of [TP, CP, PP, DP]. DP (i.e., FSDP) is the outermost parallelism because it can tolerate longer network latency by asynchronously prefetching sharded model weights and reducing gradients. Identifying the optimal parallelism configuration with minimal communication overhead while avoiding GPU memory overflow is challenging. We develop a memory consumption estimator and a performance-projection tool which helped us explore various parallelism configurations and project overall training performance and identify memory gaps effectively.

Numerical stability. By comparing training loss between different parallelism setups, we fixed several numerical issues that impact training stability. To ensure training convergence, we use FP32 gradient accumulation during backward computation over multiple micro-batches and also reduce-scatter gradients in FP32 across data parallel workers in FSDP. For intermediate tensors, e.g., vision encoder outputs, that are used multiple times in the forward computation, the backward gradients are also accumulated in FP32.

#### 3.3.3 Collective Communication

Our collective communication library for Llama 3 is based on a fork of Nvidia's NCCL library, called NCCLX. NCCLX significantly improves the performance of NCCL, especially for higher latency networks. Recall that the order of parallelism dimensions is [TP, CP, PP, DP], where DP corresponds to FSDP. The outermost parallelism dimensions, PP and DP, may communicate through a multi-hop network, with latency up to tens of microseconds. The original NCCL collectives—all-gather and reduce-scatter in FSDP, and point-to-point in PP—require data chunking and staged data copy. This approach incurs several inefficiencies, including (1) requiring a large number of small control messages to be exchanged over the network to facilitate data transfer, (2) extra memory-copy operations, and (3) using extra GPU cycles for communication. For Llama 3 training, we address a subset of these inefficiencies by tuning chunking and data transfer to fit our network latencies, which can be as high as tens of microseconds for a large cluster. We also allow small control messages to traverse our network at a higher priority, especially avoiding being head-of-line blocked in deep-buffer core switches. Our ongoing work for future Llama versions involves making deeper changes in NCCLX to holistically address all the aforementioned problems.

Table 5 Root-cause categorization of unexpected interruptions during a 54-day period of Llama 3 405B pre-training. About 78% of unexpected interruptions were attributed to confirmed or suspected hardware issues.

#### 3.3.4 Reliability and Operational Challenges

The complexity and potential failure scenarios of 16K GPU training surpass those of much larger CPU clusters that we have operated. Moreover, the synchronous nature of training makes it less fault-tolerant—a single GPU failure may require a restart of the entire job. Despite these challenges, for Llama 3, we achieved higher than 90% effective training time while supporting automated cluster maintenance, such as firmware and Linux kernel upgrades (Vigraham and Leonhardi, 2024), which resulted in at least one training interruption daily. The effective training time measures the time spent on useful training over the elapsed time.

During a 54-day snapshot period of pre-training, we experienced a total of 466 job interruptions. Of these, 47 were planned interruptions due to automated maintenance operations such as firmware upgrades or operatorinitiated operations like configuration or dataset updates. The remaining 419 were unexpected interruptions, which are classified in Table 5. Approximately 78% of the unexpected interruptions are attributed to confirmed hardware issues, such as GPU or host component failures, or suspected hardware-related issues like silent data corruption and unplanned individual host maintenance events. GPU issues are the largest category, accounting for 58.7% of all unexpected issues. Despite the large number of failures, significant manual intervention was required only three times during this period, with the rest of issues handled by automation.

To increase the effective training time, we reduced job startup and checkpointing time, and developed tools for fast diagnosis and problem resolution. We extensively use PyTorch's built-in NCCL flight recorder (Ansel et al., 2024), a feature that captures collective metadata and stack traces into a ring buffer, and hence allowing us to diagnose hangs and performance issues quickly at scale, particularly with regard to NCCLX. Using this, we efficiently record every communication event and the duration of each collective operation, and also automatically dump tracing data on NCCLX watchdog or heartbeat timeout. We enable more computationally intensive tracing operations and metadata collection selectively as needed live in production through online configuration changes (Tang et al., 2015) without needing a code release or job restart.

Debugging issues in large-scale training is complicated by the mixed use of NVLink and RoCE in our network. Data transfer over NVLink typically occurs through load/store operations issued by CUDA kernels, and failures in either the remote GPU or NVLink connectivity often manifest as stalled load/store operations within CUDA kernels without returning a clear error code. NCCLX enhances the speed and accuracy of failure

detection and localization through a tight co-design with PyTorch, allowing PyTorch to access NCCLX's internal state and track relevant information. While stalls due to NVLink failures cannot be completely prevented, our system monitors the state of the communication library and automatically times out when such a stall is detected. Additionally, NCCLX traces the kernel and network activities of each NCCLX communication and provides a snapshot of the failing NCCLX collective's internal state, including finished and pending data transfers between all ranks. We analyze this data to debug NCCLX scaling issues.

Sometimes, hardware issues may cause still-functioning but slow stragglers that are hard to detect. Even a single straggler can slow down thousands of other GPUs, often appearing as functioning but slow communications. We developed tools to prioritize potentially problematic communications from selected process groups. By investigating just a few top suspects, we were usually able to effectively identify the stragglers.

One interesting observation is the impact of environmental factors on training performance at scale. For Llama 3 405B , we noted a diurnal 1-2% throughput variation based on time-of-day. This fluctuation is the result of higher mid-day temperatures impacting GPU dynamic voltage and frequency scaling.

During training, tens of thousands of GPUs may increase or decrease power consumption at the same time, for example, due to all GPUs waiting for checkpointing or collective communications to finish, or the startup or shutdown of the entire training job. When this happens, it can result in instant fluctuations of power consumption across the data center on the order of tens of megawatts, stretching the limits of the power grid. This is an ongoing challenge for us as we scale training for future, even larger Llama models.

### 3.4 Training Recipe

The recipe used to pre-train Llama 3 405B consists of three main stages: (1) initial pre-training, (2) long-context pre-training, and (3) annealing. The three stages are described separately below. We use similar recipes to pre-train the 8B and 70B models.

### 3.4.1 Initial Pre-Training

We pre-train Llama 3 405B using AdamW with a peak learning rate of 8 × 10−5 , a linear warm up of 8,000 steps, and a cosine learning rate schedule decaying to 8 × 10−7 over 1,200,000 steps. We use a lower batch size early in training to improve training stability, and increase it subsequently to improve efficiency. Specifically, we use an initial batch size of 4M tokens and sequences of length 4,096, and double these values to a batch size of 8M sequences of 8,192 tokens after pre-training 252M tokens. We double the batch size again to 16M after pre-training on 2.87T tokens. We found this training recipe to be very stable: we observed few loss spikes and did not require interventions to correct for model training divergence.

Adjusting the data mix. We made a several adjustments to the pre-training data mix during training to improve model performance on particular downstream tasks. In particular, we increased the percentage of non-English data during pre-training to improve the multilingual performance of Llama 3. We also upsample mathematical data to improve the model's mathematical reasoning performance, we added more recent web data in the later stages of pre-training to advance the model's knowledge cut-off, and we downsampled subsets of the pre-training data that were later identified as being lower quality.

### 3.4.2 Long Context Pre-Training

In the final stages of pre-training, we train on long sequences to support context windows of up to 128K tokens. We do not train on long sequences earlier because the compute in self-attention layers grows quadratically in the sequence length. We increase the supported context length in increments, pre-training until the model has successfully adapted to the increased context length. We assess successful adaptation by measuring whether (1) model performance on short-context evaluations has recovered completely and (2) the model perfectly solves "needle in a haystack" tasks up to that length. In Llama 3 405B pre-training, we increased context length gradually in six stages, starting from the original 8K context window and ending in the final 128K context window. This long-context pre-training stage was performed using approximately 800B training tokens.

![](_page_14_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 7 Illustration of the overall post-training approach for Llama 3. Our post-training strategy involves rejection sampling, supervised finetuning, and direct preference optimization. See text for details.

#### 3.4.3 Annealing

During pre-training on the final 40M tokens, we linearly annealed the learning rate to 0, maintaining a context length of 128K tokens. During this annealing phase, we also adjusted the data mix to upsample data sources of very high quality; see Section 3.1.3. Finally, we compute the average of model checkpoints (Polyak (1991) averaging) during annealing to produce the final pre-trained model.

### 4 Post-Training

We produce the aligned Llama 3 models by applying several rounds of post-training,6 or aligning the model with human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022; Rafailov et al., 2024) on top of a pre-trained checkpoint. Each round of post-training involves supervised finetuning (SFT) followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2024) on examples collected either via human annotations or generated synthetically. Our post-training modeling and data approaches are described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 respectively. We further detail custom data curation strategies to improve the reasoning, coding, factuality, multilingual, tool use, long context, and precise instruction following in Section 4.3.

### 4.1 Modeling

The backbone of our post-training strategy is a reward model and a language model. We first train a reward model on top of the pre-trained checkpoint using human-annotated preference data (see Section 4.1.2). We then finetune pre-trained checkpoints with supervised finetuning (SFT; see Section 4.1.3), and further align the checkpoints with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; see Section 4.1.4). This process is illustrated in Figure 7. Unless otherwise noted, our modeling procedure applies to Llama 3 405B, and we refer to Llama 3 405B as Llama 3 for simplicity.

#### 4.1.1 Chat Dialog Format

To tune LLMs for human-AI interaction, we need to define a chat dialog protocol for the model to understand human instructions and perform conversational tasks. Compared to its predecessor, Llama 3 has new capabilities such as tool use (Section 4.3.5) which may require generating multiple messages and sending

<sup>6</sup>We use the term "post-training" to refer to any model training that happens outside of pre-training.

them to different locations (e.g., user, ipython) within a single dialog turn. To support this, we design a new multi-message chat protocol which uses various special header and termination tokens. The header tokens are used to indicate the source and destination of each message in a conversation. Similarly, the termination tokens indicate when it is the time to alternate between human and AI to speak.

#### 4.1.2 Reward Modeling

We train a reward model (RM) covering different capabilities on top of the pre-trained checkpoint. The training objective is the same as Llama 2 except that we remove the margin term in the loss, as we observe diminishing improvements after data scaling. Following Llama 2, we use all of our preference data for reward modeling after filtering out samples with similar responses. In addition to standard preference pair of (chosen, rejected) response, annotations also create a third "edited response" for some prompts, where the chosen response from the pair is further edited for improvement (see Section 4.2.1). Hence, each preference ranking sample has two or three responses with clear ranking (edited > chosen > rejected). We concatenate the prompt and multiple responses into a single row during training with responses randomly shuffled. This is an approximation to the standard scenario of putting the responses in separate rows and computing the scores, but in our ablations, this approach improves training efficiency without a loss in accuracy.

#### 4.1.3 Supervised Finetuning

The reward model is then used to perform rejection sampling on our human annotation prompts, the details of which are described in Section 4.2. Together with this rejection-sampled data and other data sources (including synthetic data), we finetune the pre-trained language model using a standard cross entropy loss on the target tokens (while masking loss on prompt tokens). More details about the data mix can be found in Section 4.2. We refer to this stage as supervised finetuning (SFT; Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022b), even though many of the training targets are model-generated. Our largest models are finetuned with a learning rate of 10−5 over the course of 8.5K to 9K steps. We found these hyperparameter settings to work well across different rounds and data mixes.

#### 4.1.4 Direct Preference Optimization

We further train our SFT models with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2024) for human preference alignment. For training, we primarily use the most recent batches of preference data collected using the best performing models from the previous alignment rounds. As a result, our training data conforms better to the distribution of the policy model that is being optimized in each round. We also explored on-policy algorithms such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), but found that DPO required less compute for large-scale models and performed better, especially on instruction following benchmarks like IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023). For Llama 3, we use a learning rate of 10−5 and set the β hyper-parameter to be 0.1. In addition, we apply the following algorithmic modifications to DPO:

- Masking out formatting tokens in DPO loss: We mask out special formatting tokens including header and termination tokens (described in Section 4.1.1) from both chosen and rejected responses in the loss to stabilize DPO training. We observe that having these tokens contribute to the loss may lead to undesired model behaviors such as tail repetition or abruptly generating termination tokens. We hypothesize that this is due to the contrastive nature of the DPO loss – the presence of common tokens in both chosen and rejected responses leads to a conflicting learning objective as the model needs to increase and reduce the likelihood of these tokens simultaneously.
- Regularization with NLL loss: We add an additional negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss term with a scaling coefficient of 0.2 on the chosen sequences, similar to Pang et al. (2024). This helps further stabilize DPO training by maintaining desired formatting for generation and preventing the decrease of log probability of chosen responses (Pang et al., 2024; Pal et al., 2024).

#### 4.1.5 Model Averaging

Finally, we average models obtained from experiments using various versions of data or hyperparameters at each RM, SFT, or DPO stage (Izmailov et al., 2019; Wortsman et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022).

|  | % of | Avg. # turns | Avg. # tokens | Avg. # tokens | Avg. # tokens |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dataset | comparisons | per dialog | per example | in prompt | in response |
| General English | 81.99% | 4.1 | 1,000.4 | 36.4 | 271.2 |
| Coding | 6.93% | 3.2 | 1,621.0 | 113.8 | 462.9 |
| Multilingual | 5.19% | 1.8 | 1,299.4 | 77.1 | 420.9 |
| Reasoning and tools | 5.89% | 1.6 | 707.7 | 46.6 | 129.9 |
| Total | 100% | 3.8 | 1,041.6 | 44.5 | 284.0 |

Table 6 Statistics of human preference data. We list statistics of the internally collected human preference data used for Llama 3 alignment. We ask annotators to perform multi-turn dialogues with the models and make comparisons among responses at each turn. In post-processing, we split each dialogue to multiple examples at a turn level. Each example consists of a prompt (including previous dialog if available) and a response (e.g., chosen or rejected response).

#### 4.1.6 Iterative Rounds

Following Llama 2, we apply the above methods in six rounds. In each cycle, we collect new preference annotations and SFT data, sampling synthetic data from the latest models.

#### 4.2 Post-training Data

The post-training data composition plays a critical role in the usefulness and behavior of language models. In this section, we discuss our human annotation procedures and preference data collection (Section 4.2.1), the composition of our SFT data (Section 4.2.2), and methods for data quality control and cleaning (Section 4.2.3).

#### 4.2.1 Preference Data

Our preference data annotation process is similar to Llama 2. We deploy multiple models for annotation after each round and sample two responses from two different models for each user prompt. These models can be trained with different data mixes and alignment recipes, allowing for different capability strength (e.g., code expertise) and increased data diversity. We ask annotators to rate the strength of their preference by categorizing it into one of four levels, based on how much more they prefer the chosen response over the rejected one: significantly better, better, slightly better, or marginally better. We also incorporate an editing step after preference ranking to encourage annotators to further improve the preferred response. Annotators edit the chosen response directly or prompt the model with feedback to refine its own response. Consequently, a portion of our preference data has three responses ranked (edited > chosen > rejected).

In Table 6, we report the statistics of preference annotations that we use for Llama 3 training. General English covers multiple subcategories such as knowledge-based question and answering or precise instruction-following, which fall outside the scope of specific capabilities. Compared to Llama 2, we observe an increase in the average length of prompt and response, suggesting that we train Llama 3 on more complex tasks. In addition, we implement a quality analysis and human evaluation process to rigorously assess the data collected, allowing us to refine our prompts and provide systematic, actionable feedback to annotators. For example, as Llama 3 improves after each round, we increase prompt complexity accordingly to target areas where the model lags.

In each round of post-training, we use all the preference data that is available at the time for reward modeling, while only using the latest batches from various capabilities for DPO training. For both reward modeling and DPO, we use samples that are labeled as the chosen response being significantly better or better than the rejected counterpart for training and discard samples with similar responses.

#### 4.2.2 SFT Data

Our finetuning data is largely comprised of the following sources:

- Prompts from our human annotation collection with rejection-sampled responses.
- Synthetic data targeting specific capabilities (see Section 4.3 for more details).

|  |  |  |  | Avg. # tokens | Avg. # tokens |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dataset | % of examples | Avg. # turns | Avg. # tokens | in context | in final response |
| General English | 52.66% | 6.3 | 974.0 | 656.7 | 317.1 |
| Code | 14.89% | 2.7 | 753.3 | 378.8 | 374.5 |
| Multilingual | 3.01% | 2.7 | 520.5 | 230.8 | 289.7 |
| Exam-like | 8.14% | 2.3 | 297.8 | 124.4 | 173.4 |
| Reasoning and tools | 21.19% | 3.1 | 661.6 | 359.8 | 301.9 |
| Long context | 0.11% | 6.7 | 38,135.6 | 37,395.2 | 740.5 |
| Total | 100% | 4.7 | 846.1 | 535.7 | 310.4 |

Table 7 Statistics of SFT data. We list internally collected SFT data used for Llama 3 alignment. Each SFT example consists of a context (i.e., all conversation turns except the last one) and a final response.

- Small amounts of human-curated data (see Section 4.3 for more details).
As our post-training rounds progress, we develop stronger Llama 3 variants that we use to collect larger datasets that cover a wide range of complex capabilities. In this section, we discuss the details for the rejection-sampling procedure and overall composition of our final SFT datamix.

Rejection sampling. During rejection sampling (RS), for each prompt collected during human annotation (Section 4.2.1) we sample K (typically between 10 and 30) outputs from the latest chat model policy (usually the best performing checkpoint from the previous post-training iteration, or the best performing checkpoint for a particular capability) and use our reward model to select the best candidate, consistent with Bai et al. (2022). In later rounds of post-training, we introduce system prompts to steer RS responses to conform with desirable tone, style, or formatting, which might be different for different capabilities.

To increase the efficiency of rejection sampling, we adopt PagedAttention (Kwon et al., 2023). PagedAttention enhances memory efficiency through dynamic key-value cache allocation. It supports arbitrary output lengths by dynamically scheduling requests based on the current cache capacity. Unfortunately, this carries the risk of swap-out when running out of memory. To eliminate such swap overhead, we define a maximum output length and perform a request only if sufficient memory is available to fit an output with that length. PagedAttention also enables us to share the key-value cache pages for a prompt across all corresponding outputs. Together, this leads to a throughput improvement of over 2× during rejection sampling.

Overall data composition. Table 7 shows data statistics for each broad category of our "helpfulness" mix. While SFT and preference data contain overlapping domains, they are curated differently, yielding distinct count statistics. In Section 4.2.3 we describe techniques for categorizing topic, complexity, and quality of our data samples. In each round of post-training, we adjust our overall data mix carefully across these axes to tune performance across a wide range of benchmarks. Our final data mix epochs multiple times on some high quality sources and downsamples others.

#### 4.2.3 Data Processing and Quality Control

Given that most of our training data is model-generated, it requires careful cleaning and quality control.

Data cleaning. In the early rounds, we observed a number of undesirable patterns common in our data, such as excessive use of emojis or exclamation points. Therefore, we implement a series of rule-based data removal and modification strategies to filter or clean problematic data. For example, to mitigate overly-apologetic tonal issues, we identify overused phrases (such as "I'm sorry" or "I apologize") and carefully balance the proportion of such samples in our dataset.

Data pruning. We also apply a collection of model-based techniques to remove low-quality training samples and improve overall model performance:

- Topic classification: We first finetune Llama 3 8B into a topic classifier, and perform inference over all data to classify it into both coarsely-grained buckets ("mathematical reasoning") and fine-grained
buckets ("geometry and trigonometry").

- Quality scoring: We use both reward model and Llama-based signals to obtain a quality score for each sample. For an RM-based score, we consider data that is in the top quartile of RM scores as high quality. For a Llama-based score, we prompt Llama 3 checkpoint to rate each sample on a three-point scale for general English data (accuracy, instruction following, and tone/presentation) and a two-point scale for coding data (bug identification and user intention), and consider samples that obtain the maximum score as high quality. The RM and Llama-based scores have high disagreement rates, and we find that combining these signals yield the best recall on our internal test set. Ultimately, we select examples that are marked as high quality by the RM or the Llama-based filter.
- Difficulty scoring: Because we are also interested in prioritizing examples that are more complex for the model, we score data using two measures of difficulty: Instag (Lu et al., 2023) and Llama-based scoring. For Instag, we prompt Llama 3 70B to perform intention tagging of SFT prompts, where more intentions implies more complexity. We also prompt Llama 3 to measure the difficulty (Liu et al., 2024c) of dialogs on a three-point scale.
- Semantic deduplication: Finally, we perform semantic deduplication (Abbas et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024c). We first cluster complete dialogs using RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b) and within each cluster sort them by quality score × difficulty score. We then do greedy selection by iterating through all sorted examples, and only keeping the ones that have maximum cosine similarity less than a threshold to the examples seen so far in the cluster.

### 4.3 Capabilities

We highlight special efforts to improve performance for specific capabilities such as code (Section 4.3.1), multilinguality (Section 4.3.2), math and reasoning (Section 4.3.3), long context (Section 4.3.4), tool use (Section 4.3.5), factuality (Section 4.3.6), and steerability (Section 4.3.7).

### 4.3.1 Code

LLMs for code have received significant attention since the release of Copilot and Codex (Chen et al., 2021). Developers are now widely using these models to generate code snippets, debug, automate tasks, and improve code quality. For Llama 3, we target improving and evaluating code generation, documentation, debugging, and review capabilities for the following high priority programming languages: Python, Java, Javascript, C/C++, Typescript, Rust, PHP, HTML/CSS, SQL, bash/shell. Here, we present our work on improving these coding capabilities via training a code expert, generating synthetic data for SFT, improving formatting with system prompt steering, and creating quality filters to remove bad samples from our training data.

Expert training. We train a code expert which we use to collect high quality human annotations for code throughout subsequent rounds of post-training. This is accomplished by branching the main pre-training run and continuing pre-training on a 1T token mix of mostly (>85%) code data. Continued pre-training on domainspecific data has been shown to be effective for improving performance in a specific domain (Gururangan et al., 2020). We follow a recipe similar to that of CodeLlama (Rozière et al., 2023). For the last several thousand steps of training we perform long-context finetuning (LCFT) to extend the expert's context length to 16K tokens on a high quality mix of repo-level code data. Finally, we follow the similar post-training modeling recipes described in Section 4.1 to align this model, except with SFT and DPO data mixes primarily targeting code. This model is also used for rejection sampling (Section 4.2.2) for coding prompts.

Synthetic data generation. During development, we identified key issues in code generation, including difficulty in following instructions, code syntax errors, incorrect code generation, and difficulty in fixing bugs. While intensive human annotation could theoretically resolve these issues, synthetic data generation offers a complementary approach at a lower cost and higher scale, unconstrained by the expertise level of annotators. As such, we use Llama 3 and the code expert to generate a large quantity of synthetic SFT dialogs.

We describe three high-level approaches for generating synthetic code data. In total, we generate over 2.7M synthetic examples which were used during SFT.

- 1. Synthetic data generation: execution feedback. The 8B and 70B models show significant performance improvements when trained on data generated by a larger, more competent model. However, our initial experiments revealed that training Llama 3 405B on its own generated data is not helpful (and can even degrade performance). To address this limitation, we introduced execution feedback as a source of truth, enabling the model to learn from its mistakes and stay on track. In particular, we generate large dataset of approximately one million synthetic coding dialogues using the following process:
	- Problem description generation: First, we generate a large collection of programming problem descriptions that span a diverse range of topics, including those in the long tail distribution. To achieve this diversity, we sample random code snippets from various sources and prompt the model to generate programming problems inspired by these examples. This allowed us to tap into a wide range of topics and create a comprehensive set of problem descriptions (Wei et al., 2024).
	- Solution generation: Then, we prompt Llama 3 to solve each problem in a given programming language. We observe that adding general rules of good programming to the prompt improves the generated solution quality. Also, we find it is helpful to require the model to explain its thought process in comments.
	- Correctness analysis: After generating a solution, it is crucial to recognize that its correctness is not guaranteed, and including incorrect solutions in the finetuning dataset could harm the model's quality. While we do not ensure complete correctness, we develop methods to approximate it. To achieve this, we extract the source code from the generated solution and applied a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques to test its correctness, including:
		- Static analysis: We run all generated code through a parser and a linter to ensure syntactic correctness, catching errors such as syntax errors, use of uninitialized variables or non-imported functions, code style issues, typing errors, and others.
		- Unit test generation and execution: For each problem and solution, we prompt the model to generate unit tests, executed in a containerized environment together with the solution, catching run-time execution errors and some semantic errors.
	- Error feedback and iterative self-correction: When a solution fails at any step, we prompt the model to revise it. The prompt included the original problem description, the faulty solution, and feedback from the parser/linter/tester (stdout, stderr/ and return code). After a unit test execution failure, the model could either fix the code to pass the existing tests or modify its unit tests to accommodate the generated code. Only dialogs that pass all checks are included in the final dataset, used for supervised finetuning (SFT). Notably, we observed that about 20% of solutions were initially incorrect but self-corrected, indicating that the model learned from the execution feedback and improved its performance.
	- Fine-tuning and iterative improvement: The finetuning process is conducted over multiple rounds, with each round building on the previous one. After each round, the model is improved, generating higher-quality synthetic data for the next round. This iterative process allows for progressive refinement and enhancement of the model's performance.
- 2. Synthetic data generation: programming language translation. We observe a performance gap between major programming languages (e.g., Python/C++) and less common ones (e.g., Typescript/PHP). This is not surprising as we have less training data for less common programming languages. To mitigate this, we supplement our existing data by translating data from common programming languages to less common languages (similar to Chen et al. (2023) in the context of reasoning). This is achieved by prompting Llama 3 and ensuring quality via syntax parsing, compilation, and execution. Figure 8 demonstrates an example of synthetic PHP code translated from Python. This improves performance significantly for less common languages as measured by the MultiPL-E (Cassano et al., 2023) benchmark.
- 3. Synthetic data generation: backtranslation. To improve certain coding capabilities (e.g., documentation, explanations) where execution feedback is less informative for determining quality, we employ an alternative multi-step approach. Using this procedure, we generated approximately 1.2M synthetic

Figure 8 Code translation example. We display an example of using Llama 3 to translate Python code (left) to PHP code (right) to augment our SFT dataset with a wider range of programming languages.

dialogs related to code explanation, generation, documentation, and debugging. Beginning with code snippets from a variety of languages in our pre-training data:

- Generate: We prompt Llama 3 to generate data that represents our target capability (e.g., we add comments and docstrings for the code snippet, or we ask the model to explain a piece of code).
- Backtranslate: We then prompt the model to "backtranslate" the synthetically generated data to the original code (e.g., we prompt the model to generate code only from its documentation, or we ask the model to generate code only from its explanation).
- Filter: Using the original code as a reference, we prompt the Llama 3 to determine the quality of the output (e.g., we ask the model how faithful the backtranslated code is to the original). We then use the generated examples that have the highest self-verification scores in SFT.

System prompt steering during rejection sampling. During the rejection sampling process, we used code specific system prompts to improve code readability, documentation, thoroughness, and specificity. Recall, from Section 7 this data is used to finetune the language model. Figure 9 shows an example of how the system prompt helps improve the generated code quality — it adds necessary comments, uses more informative variable names, saves memory, etc.

Filtering training data with execution and model-as-judge signals. As described in Section 4.2.3, we occasionally encounter quality issues in our rejection-sampled data, such as code blocks containing bugs. Detecting these issues in our rejection-sampled data is not as straightforward as it is for our synthetic code data, as the rejection-sampled responses typically contain a mix of natural language and code for which the code may not always be expected to be executable. (For example, user prompts may explicitly ask for pseudo-code or edits to only a very small snippet of an executable program.) To address this, we utilize the "model-as-judge" approach, where earlier versions of Llama 3 assess and assign a binary (0/1) score based on two criteria: code correctness and code style. We retain only those samples that achieve a perfect score of 2. Initially, this stringent filtering led to a regression in downstream benchmark performance, primarily because it disproportionately removed examples with challenging prompts. To counteract this, we strategically revise the responses of some coding data categorized as most challenging until they met the Llama-based "model-as-judge" criteria. By refining these challenging problems, the coding data achieves a balance between quality and difficulty, resulting in optimal downstream performance.

#### 4.3.2 Multilinguality

We describe how we improve Llama 3's multilingual capabilities, including training an expert specialized on substantially more multilingual data, sourcing and generating high quality multilingual instruction tuning data for German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai, and tackling specific challenges of multilingual language steering to enhance the overall performance of our model.

Expert training. Our Llama 3 pre-training data mix contains significantly more English tokens than non-English tokens. To collect higher quality human annotations in non-English languages, we train a multilingual expert by branching off the pre-training run and continuing to pre-train on a data mix that consists of 90% multilingual tokens. We then perform post-training on this expert following Section 4.1. This expert model is then used to collect higher quality annotations in non-English languages until pre-training was fully complete.

Multilingual data collection. Our multilingual SFT data is derived primarily from sources described below. The overall distribution is 2.4% human annotations, 44.2% data from other NLP tasks, 18.8% rejection sampled data, and 34.6% translated reasoning data.

- Human annotations: We collect high-quality, manually annotated data from linguists and native speakers. These annotations mostly consist of open-ended prompts that represent real world use cases.
- Data from other NLP tasks: To further augment, we use multilingual training data from other tasks and rewrite into dialog format. For example, we use data from exams-qa (Hardalov et al., 2020) and Conic10k (Wu et al., 2023). To improve language alignment, we also use parallel texts from GlobalVoices (Prokopidis et al., 2016) and Wikimedia (Tiedemann, 2012). We use LID based filtering and Blaser2.0 (Seamless Communication et al., 2023) to remove low quality data. For parallel text data, instead of using the bitext pairs directly, we apply a multilingual template inspired by Wei et al. (2022a) to better simulate real-life conversations in translation and language learning scenarios.
- Rejection sampled data: We apply rejection sampling on our human annotated prompts to generate high-quality samples for finetuning, with few modifications compared to the process for English data:
	- Generation: We explored randomly choosing the temperature hyperparameter from the range 0.2 − 1 for diverse generations in early rounds of post-training. With high temperature, responses for multilingual prompts can get creative and inspiring, but are also susceptible to unnecessary or unnatural code-switching. In the final round of post-training, we use a constant value of 0.6 to balance the trade-off. Additionally, we used specialized system prompts to improve response format, structure and general readability.
	- Selection: Prior to reward model based selection, we implement multilingual-specific checks to ensure high language-match rate between the prompt and response (e.g., a romanized Hindi prompt should not expect a response in Hindi Devanagari script).
- Translated data: We try to avoid using machine-translated data to finetune the model in order to prevent translationese (Bizzoni et al., 2020; Muennighoff et al., 2023) or possible name bias (Wang et al., 2022a), gender bias (Savoldi et al., 2021), or cultural bias (Ji et al., 2023). Moreover, we aim to prevent the model from being exposed only to tasks that are rooted in English cultural context, which may not be representative of the linguistic and cultural diversity we aim to capture. We made one exception to this and translated our synthetic quantitative reasoning data (see Section 4.3.3 for details) to improve performance in quantitative reasoning in non-English languages. Due to the simple nature of

the language in these math problems, the translated samples were found to have little to no quality issues. We observed strong gains on MGSM (Shi et al., 2022) from adding this translated data.

#### 4.3.3 Math and Reasoning

We define reasoning as the ability to perform multi-step computations and arrive at the correct final answer. Several challenges guide our approach to training models that excel in mathematical reasoning:

- Lack of prompts: As the complexity of questions increases, the number of valid prompts or questions for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) decreases. This scarcity makes it difficult to create diverse and representative training datasets for teaching models various mathematical skills (Yu et al., 2023; Yue et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023; Mitra et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024; Yue et al., 2024b).
- Lack of ground truth chain of thought: Effective reasoning requires a step-by-step solution to facilitate the reasoning process (Wei et al., 2022c). However, there is often a shortage of ground truth chains of thought, which are essential for guiding the model how to break down the problem step-by-step and reach the final answer (Zelikman et al., 2022).
- Incorrect intermediate steps: When using model-generated chains of thought, the intermediate steps may not always be correct (Cobbe et al., 2021; Uesato et al., 2022; Lightman et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a). This inaccuracy can lead to incorrect final answers and needs to be addressed.
- Teaching models to use external tools: Enhancing models to utilize external tools, such as code interpreters, allows them to reason by interleaving code and text (Gao et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2022; Gou et al., 2023). This capability can significantly improve their problem-solving abilities.
- Discrepancy between training and inference: There is often a discrepancy between how the model is finetuned during training and how it is used during inference. During inference, the finetuned model may interact with humans or other models, requiring it to improve its reasoning using feedback. Ensuring consistency between training and real-world usage is crucial for maintaining reasoning performance.

To address these challenges, we apply the following methodologies:

- Addressing the lack of prompts: We source relevant pre-training data from mathematical contexts and converted it into a question-answer format which can then be used for supervised finetuning. Additionally, we identify mathematical skills where the model under-performs and actively sourced prompts from humans to teach models such skills. To facilitate this process, we create a taxonomy of mathematical skills (Didolkar et al., 2024) and ask humans to provide relevant prompts/questions accordingly.
- Augmenting training data with step-wise reasoning traces: We use Llama 3 to generate step-by-step solutions for a set of prompts. For each prompt, the model produces a variable number of generations. These generations are then filtered based on the correct answer (Li et al., 2024a). We also do selfverification where Llama 3 is used to verify whether a particular step-by-step solution is valid for a given question. This process improves the quality of the finetuning data by eliminating instances where the model does not produce valid reasoning traces.
- Filtering incorrect reasoning traces: We train outcome and stepwise reward models (Lightman et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a) to filter training data where the intermediate reasoning steps were incorrect. These reward models are used to eliminate data with invalid step-by-step reasoning, ensuring high-quality data for finetuning. For more challenging prompts, we use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with learned step-wise reward models to generate valid reasoning traces, further enhancing the collection of high-quality reasoning data (Xie et al., 2024).
- Interleaving code and text reasoning: We prompt Llama 3 to solve reasoning problems through a combination of textual reasoning and associated Python code (Gou et al., 2023). Code execution is used as a feedback signal to eliminate cases where the reasoning chain was not valid, ensuring the correctness of the reasoning process.
- Learning from feedback and mistakes: To simulate human feedback, we utilize incorrect generations (i.e., generations leading to incorrect reasoning traces) and perform error correction by prompting Llama 3 to

yield correct generations (An et al., 2023b; Welleck et al., 2022; Madaan et al., 2024a). The iterative process of using feedback from incorrect attempts and correcting them helps improve the model's ability to reason accurately and learn from its mistakes.

#### 4.3.4 Long Context

During the final pre-training stage, we extend the context length of Llama 3 from 8K tokens to 128K tokens (see Section 3.4 for more details). Similar to pre-training, we find that during finetuning we must carefully tune the recipe to balance short and long-context capabilities.

SFT and synthetic data generation. Naively applying our existing SFT recipe with only short-context data resulted in significant regressions in long-context capabilities from pre-training, highlighting the need to incorporate long-context data in our SFT data mix. In practice, however, it is largely impractical to get humans to annotate such examples due to the tedious and time-consuming nature of reading lengthy contexts, so we predominantly rely on synthetic data to fill this gap. We use earlier versions of Llama 3 to generate synthetic data based on the key long-context use-cases: (possibly multi-turn) question-answering, summarization for long documents, and reasoning over code repositories, and describe them in greater detail below.

- Question answering: We carefully curate a set of long documents from our pre-training mix. We split these documents into chunks of 8K tokens, and prompted an earlier version of the Llama 3 model to generate QA pairs conditional on randomly selected chunks. During training, the whole document is used as context.
- Summarization: We applied hierarchical summarization of long-context documents by first summarizing the chunks of 8K input length using our strongest Llama 3 8K context model and then summarizing the summaries. During training we provide the full document and prompt the model to summarize the document while preserving all the important details. We also generate QA pairs based on the summaries of the documents and prompt the model with questions that require global understanding of the whole long document.
- Long context code reasoning: We parse Python files to identify import statements and determine their dependencies. From here, we select the most commonly depended-upon files, specifically those referenced by at least five other files. We remove one of these key files from a repository and prompt the model to identify which files depended on the missing file and to generate the necessary missing code.

We further categorize these synthetically generated samples based on the sequence length (16K, 32K, 64K and 128K) to enable more fine-grained targeting of input lengths.

Through careful ablations, we observe that mixing 0.1% of synthetically generated long-context data with the original short-context data optimizes the performance across both short-context and long-context benchmarks.

DPO. We observe that using only short context training data in DPO did not negatively impact long-context performance as long as the SFT model is high quality in long context tasks. We suspect this is due to the fact that our DPO recipe has fewer optimizer steps than SFT. Given this finding, we keep the standard short-context recipe for DPO on top of our long-context SFT checkpoints.

#### 4.3.5 Tool Use

Teaching LLMs to use tools such as search engines or code interpreters hugely expands the range of tasks they can solve, transforming them from pure chat models into more general assistants (Nakano et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Parisi et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023; Mialon et al., 2023a; Schick et al., 2024). We train Llama 3 to interact with the following tools:

- Search engine. Llama 3 is trained to use Brave Search7 to answer questions about recent events that go beyond its knowledge cutoff or that require retrieving a particular piece of information from the web.
- Python interpreter. Llama 3 can generate and execute code to perform complex computations, read files uploaded by the user and solve tasks based on them such as question answering, summarization, data analysis or visualization.

<sup>7</sup>https://brave.com/search/api/

- Mathematical computational engine. Llama 3 can use the Wolfram Alpha API8 to more accurately solve math, science problems, or retrieve accurate information from Wolfram's database.
The resulting model is able to use these tools in a chat setup to solve the user's queries, including in multi-turn dialogs. If a query requires multiple tool calls, the model can write a step-by-step plan, call the tools in sequence, and do reasoning after each tool call.

We also improve Llama 3's zero-shot tool use capabilities — given in-context, potentially unseen tool definitions and a user query, we train the model to generate the correct tool call.

Implementation. We implement our core tools as Python objects with different methods. Zero-shot tools can be implemented as Python functions with descriptions, documentation (i.e., examples for how to use them), and the model only needs the function's signature and docstring as context to generate the appropriate call. We also convert function definitions and calls to JSON format, e.g., for web API calls. All tool calls are executed by the Python interpreter, that must be enabled in the Llama 3 system prompt. Core tools can be individually enabled or disabled in the system prompt.

Data collection. Different from Schick et al. (2024), we rely on human annotations and preferences to teach Llama 3 to use tools. There are two main differences with the post-training pipeline generally used in Llama 3:

- For tools, dialogs often contain more than a single assistant message (e.g., calling the tool and reasoning about the tool output). Thus, we annotate at the message level to collect granular feedback: annotators provide a preference between two assistant messages with the same context or, if both contain major problems, edit one of the messages. The chosen or edited message is then added to the context and the dialog continues. This provides human feedback for both the assistant's ability of calling the tools and reasoning about the tool outputs. Annotators cannot rank or edit the tool outputs.
- We do not perform rejection sampling, as we did not observe gains in our tool benchmarks.

To accelerate the annotation process, we start by bootstrapping basic tool use capabilities by finetuning on synthetically generated data from previous Llama 3 checkpoints. Thus, annotators have fewer edits to perform. In a similar spirit, as Llama 3 gradually improves through its development, we progressively complexify our human annotation protocols: we start by single-turn tool use annotations, before moving to tool use in dialogs, and finally annotating for multi-step tool use and data analysis.

Tool datasets. To create data for tool usage applications, we leverage the following procedure:

- Single-step tool use: We start by few-shot generation of synthetic user prompts which, by construction, require a call to one of our core tools (for example, questions that exceed our knowledge cutoff date). Then, still relying on few-shot generation, we generate appropriate tool calls for these prompts, execute them, and add the output to the model's context. Finally, we prompt the model again to generate a final answer to the user's query based on the tool output. We end up with trajectories of the following form: system prompt, user prompt, tool call, tool output, final answer. We also filter around 30% this dataset to remove tool calls that cannot be executed or other formatting issues.
- Multi-step tool use: We follow a similar protocol and first generate synthetic data to teach the model basic multi-step tool use capabilities. To do this, we first prompt Llama 3 to generate user prompts that require at least two tool calls, that can be the same or different tools from our core set. Then, conditioned on these prompts, we few-shot prompt Llama 3 to generate a solution consisting of interleaved reasoning steps and tool calls, similar to ReAct (Yao et al., 2022). See Figure 10 for an example of Llama 3 performing a task involving multi-step tool usage.
- File uploads: We annotate for the following filetypes: .txt, .docx, .pdf, .pptx, .xlsx, .csv, .tsv, .py, .json, .jsonl, .html, .xml. Our prompts are based on a provided file, and ask to summarize the contents of the file, find and fix bugs, optimize a piece of code, perform data analysis or visualization. See Figure 11 for an example of Llama 3 performing a task involving a file upload.

After finetuning on this synthetic data, we gather human annotations in diverse and challenging scenarios including multi-turn interactions, more than three step tool use, and instances where a tool call does not yield

a satisfying answer. We augment our synthetic data with different system prompts to teach the model to use tools only when activated. To train the model to avoid calling tools for simple queries, we also add queries from easy math or question answering datasets (Berant et al., 2013; Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016; Joshi et al., 2017; Amini et al., 2019) and their responses without tools, but with tools activated in system prompt.

Zero-shot tool use data. We improve Llama 3 zero-shot tool use abilities (also referred to as function calling) by finetuning on a large and diverse set of partly synthetic (functions definitions, user query, corresponding call) tuples. We evaluate our model on a set of unseen tools.

- Single, nested, and parallel function calling: Calls can be simple, nested, i.e. we pass a function call as an argument of another function, or parallel, i.e. the model returns a list of independent function calls. Generating a diverse set of functions, queries and ground truths can be challenging (Mekala et al., 2024), and we resort to mining the Stack (Kocetkov et al., 2022) to ground our synthetic user queries in real functions. More precisely, we extract function calls and their definitions, clean and filter them, e.g. for missing docstrings or non-executable functions, and use Llama 3 to generate a natural language query corresponding to the function call.
- Multi-turn function calling: We also generate synthetic data for multi-turn dialogs with function calls, following a protocol similar to the one proposed in Li et al. (2023b). We use multiple agents that generate domains, APIs, user queries, API calls, and responses, while also ensuring that the generated data covers a set of diverse domains and realistic APIs. All agents are variants of Llama 3 prompted in different ways depending on their roles and collaborate in a step-by-step manner.

#### 4.3.6 Factuality

Hallucinations remain a major challenge for large language models. Models tend to be overconfident, even in domains where they have little knowledge. Despite these shortcomings, they are often used as knowledge bases, which can lead to risky outcomes such as the spread of misinformation. While we recognize that factuality can go beyond hallucinations, we took a hallucination-first approach here.

We follow the principle that post-training should align the model to "know what it knows" rather than add knowledge (Gekhman et al., 2024; Mielke et al., 2020). Our primary approach involves generating data that aligns model generations with subsets of factual data present in the pre-training data. To achieve this, we develop a knowledge probing technique that takes advantage of Llama 3's in-context abilities. This data generation process involves the following procedure:

- 1. Extract a data snippet from the pre-training data.
- 2. Generate a factual question about these snippets (context) by prompting Llama 3.
- 3. Sample responses from Llama 3 to the question.
- 4. Score the correctness of the generations using the original context as a reference and Llama 3 as a judge.
- 5. Score the informativeness of the generations using Llama 3 as a judge.
- 6. Generate a refusal for responses which are consistently informative and incorrect across the generations, using Llama 3.

We use data generated from the knowledge probe to encourage the model to only answer questions which it has knowledge about, and refuse answering those questions that it is unsure about. Further, pre-training data is not always factually consistent or correct. We therefore also collect a limited set of labeled factuality data that deals with sensitive topics where factually contradictory or incorrect statements are prevalent.

#### 4.3.7 Steerability

Steerability is the ability to direct the model's actions and outcomes to meet developer and user specifications. As Llama 3 is a generic foundational model, it should be maximally steerable to different downstream use cases easily. For Llama 3, we focus on enhancing its steerability through system prompt with natural language instructions, especially around response length, format, tone and character/persona.

Data collection. We collect steerability preference samples within the general English category by asking annotators to design different system prompts for Llama 3. Annotators then engage in conversations with the models to evaluate their consistency in following instructions defined in system prompts over the course of the conversation. We show an example customized system prompt used for enhancing steerability below:

You are a helpful and cheerful AI Chatbot that acts as a meal plan assistant for busy families. The family consists of 2 adults, 3 teenagers, and 2 preschoolers. Plan two or three days at a time and use leftovers or extra ingredients for the second day's plan. The user will let you know if they want two or three days. If they don't, assume three days. Each plan should include breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner. Ask the user if they approve of the plan or need adjustments. After they approve provide a grocery list with family size in mind. Always keep family preferences in mind and if there's something that they don't like provide a substitution. If the user is not feeling inspired then ask them what's the one place they wish they could visit on vacation this week and then suggest meals based on that location's culture. Weekend meals can be more complex. Weekday meals should be quick and easy. For breakfast and lunch, easy food like cereal, English muffins with pre-cooked bacon, and other quick easy foods are preferred. The family is busy. Be sure to ask if they have essentials and favorites on hand like coffee or energy drinks so they don't forget to buy it. Remember to be budget-conscious unless it's a special occasion.

Modeling. After we collect the preference data, we leverage this data in reward modeling, rejection sampling, SFT, and DPO to enhance Llama 3's steerability.

### 5 Results

We performed an extensive series of evaluations of Llama 3, investigating the performance of: (1) the pre-trained language model, (2) the post-trained language model, and (3) the safety characteristics of Llama 3. We present the results of these evaluations in separate subsections below.

### 5.1 Pre-trained Language Model

In this section, we report evaluation results for our pre-trained Llama 3 (Section 3), comparing with various other models of comparable sizes. We reproduce results of competitor models whenever possible. For non-Llama models, we report the best score across results that are publicly reported or (where possible) that we reproduced ourselves. The specifics of these evaluations, including configurations such as the number of shots, metrics, and other pertinent hyperparameters and settings, can be accessed on our Github repository here. Additionally, we are releasing the data generated as part of evaluations with publicly available benchmarks which can be found on Huggingface here. We evaluate the quality of our models on standard benchmarks (Section 5.1.1), for robustness to changes in multiple-choice question setups (Section 5.1.2), and on adversarial evaluations (Section 5.1.3). We also conduct a contamination analysis to estimate the extent to which our evaluations are impacted by contamination of training data (Section 5.1.4).

#### 5.1.1 Standard Benchmarks

To compare our models with the current state-of-the-art, we evaluate Llama 3 on a large number of standard benchmark evaluations shown in Table 8. These evaluations cover eight top-level categories: (1) commonsense reasoning; (2) knowledge; (3) reading comprehension; (4) math, reasoning, and problem solving; (5) long context; (6) code; (7) adversarial evaluations; and (8) aggregate evaluations.

Table 8 Pre-training benchmarks by category. Overview of all benchmarks we use to evaluate pre-trained Llama 3 models, grouped by capability category.

Experimental setup. For each benchmark, we compute scores for Llama 3 as well as various other pre-trained models of comparable sizes. Where possible, we recompute numbers with our own pipeline for other models. To ensure a fair comparison, we then select the best score between the score that we computed and the reported number for that model with comparable or more conservative settings. You can find additional details on our evaluation setup here. For some models, it is not possible to (re)compute benchmark values, for instance, because the pre-trained model is not released or because the API does not provide access to log-probabilities. In particular, this is true for all models comparable to Llama 3 405B. Thus, we do not report category averages for Llama 3 405B, which requires that all numbers are available for all benchmarks.

Significance estimates. Benchmark scores are estimates of a model's true performance. These estimates have variance because benchmark sets are finite samples drawn from some underlying distribution. We follow Madaan et al. (2024b) and report on this variance via 95% confidence intervals (CIs), assuming that benchmark scores are Gaussian distributed. While this assumption is incorrect (e.g., benchmark scores are bounded), preliminary bootstrap experiments suggest CIs (for discrete metrics) are a good approximation:

$$C I(S)=1.96\times{\sqrt{\frac{S\times(1-S)}{N}}}.$$

Herein, S is the observed benchmark score (e.g., accuracy or EM) and N the sample size of the benchmark. We omit CIs for benchmark scores that are not simple averages. We note that because subsampling is not the only source of variation, our CI values lower bound the actual variation in the capability estimate.

Results for 8B and 70B models. Figure 12 reports the average performance of Llama 3 8B and 70B on the commonsense reasoning, knowledge, reading comprehension, math and reasoning, and code benchmarks. The results show that Llama 3 8B outperforms competing models in virtually every category, both in terms of per-category win rate and in terms of average per-category performance. We also find that Llama 3 70B outperforms its predecessor Llama 2 70B by a large margin on most benchmarks, with the exception of commonsense benchmarks that are likely saturated. Llama 3 70B also outperforms Mixtral 8x22B.

Detailed results for all models. Table 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 present the benchmark performance of pre-trained Llama 3 8B, 70B, and 405B models on reading comprehension tasks, coding tasks, commonsense understanding tasks, mathematical reasoning tasks, and general tasks. The tables compare Llama 3's performance with that

of models of similar size. The results show that Llama 3 405B performs competitively with other models in its class. In particular, Llama 3 405B substantially outperforms prior open-source models. For long-context, we present more comprehensive results (including probing tasks like needle-in-a-haystack) in Section 5.2.

#### 5.1.2 Model Robustness

In addition to performance on benchmarks, robustness is an important factor in the quality of pre-trained language models. We investigate the robustness of our pre-trained language models to design choices in multiple-choice question (MCQ) setups. Prior work has reported that model performance can be sensitive to seemingly arbitrary design choices in such setups, for example, model scores and even rankings may change with the order and labels of the in-context examples (Lu et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2021; Robinson and Wingate, 2023; Liang et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2024), the exact format of the prompt (Weber et al., 2023b; Mishra et al., 2022), or the answer choice format and order (Alzahrani et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a; Zheng et al., 2023). Motivated by this work, we use the MMLU benchmark to evaluate the robustness of our pre-trained models to: (1) few-shot label bias, (2) label variants, (3) answer order, and (4) prompt format:

- Few-shot label bias. Following Zheng et al. (2023) and Weber et al. (2023a), we investigate the impact of the distribution of labels in four-shot examples. Specifically, we consider settings in which: (1) all

few-shot examples have the same label (A A A A); (2) all examples have a different label (A B C D); and (3) there are only two labels present (A A B B and C C D D).

- Label variants. We also study model response to different choice token sets. We consider the two sets proposed by Alzahrani et al. (2024): namely, a set of common language independent tokens ($ & # @) and a of rare tokens (œ § з ü) that do not have any implicit relative order. We also consider two versions of the canonical labels (A. B. C. D. and A) B) C) D)) and a numerical list (1. 2. 3. 4.).
- Answer order. Following Wang et al. (2024a), we compute how stable the results are across different answer orders. To compute this, we remap all the answers in the dataset according to a fixed permutation. For example, for the permutation A B C D, all answer options with label A and B keep their label, and all answer options with label C get label D, and vice versa.
- Prompt format. We evaluate variance in performance across five task prompts that differ in the level of information provided: one prompt simply asks the model to answer the question, whereas other prompts assert the expertise of the model or that the best answer should be chosen.

Figure 13 presents the results of our experiments studying robustness of model performance to label variants (left) and few-shot label bias (right). The results show that our pre-trained language models are very robust to changes in MCQ labels and to the structure of the few-shot prompt labels. This robustness is particularly

pronounced for the 405B parameter model. Figure 14 presents the results of our study of robustness to answer order and prompt format. The results in the figure further underscore the robustness of the performance of our pre-trained language models, in particular, of Llama 3 405B.

#### 5.1.3 Adversarial Benchmarks

In addition to the benchmarks presented above, we evaluate on several adversarial benchmarks in three areas: question answering, mathematical reasoning, and paraphrase detection. This testing probes the model's capabilities on tasks specifically created to be challenging and can potentially also point to overfitting on benchmarks. For question answering, we use Adversarial SQuAD (Jia and Liang, 2017) and Dynabench SQuAD (Kiela et al., 2021). For mathematical reasoning, we use GSM-Plus (Li et al., 2024c). For paraphrase detection, we use PAWS (Zhang et al., 2019).

Figure 15 presents the scores of Llama 3 8B, 70B, and 405B on the adversarial benchmarks as a function of their performance on non-adversarial benchmarks. The non-adversarial benchmarks we use are SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) for question answering, GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and QQP (Wang et al., 2017) for paraphrase detection. Each datapoint represents a pair of an adversarial and non-adversarial datasets (e.g. QQP paired with PAWS), and we show all possible pairs within a category. The diagonal black line represents parity between adversarial and non-adversarial datasets — being on the line would indicate the model has similar performance regardless of the adversarial nature.

On paraphrase detection, neither pre-trained nor post-trained models appear to suffer from the type of adversariality with which PAWS was constructed, marking a substantial step with respect to the previous generation of models. This result confirms the findings of Weber et al. (2023a), who also found that LLMs are less susceptible to the type of spurious correlations found in several adversarial datasets. For mathematical reasoning and question answering, however, the adversarial performances are substantially lower than the non-adversarial performances. This pattern is similar for pre-trained and post-trained models.

#### 5.1.4 Contamination Analysis

We conduct a contamination analysis to estimate to what extent benchmark scores may be influenced by contamination of the evaluation data in the pre-training corpus. In previous work, several different contamination methods have been used, with various different hyperparameters – we refer to Singh et al. (2024) for an overview. Any of these methods can suffer from false positives and negatives, and how to best run contamination analyses is currently still an open field of research. Here, we largely follow the suggestions of Singh et al. (2024).

Method. Specifically, Singh et al. (2024) propose to select contamination detection methods empirically, based on which method results in the largest difference between the 'clean' part of the dataset and the entire dataset, which they call estimated performance gain. For all our evaluation datasets, we score examples based on 8-gram overlap, a method that was found by Singh et al. (2024) to be accurate for many datasets. We consider an example of a dataset D to be contaminated if a ratio TD of its tokens are part of an 8-gram occurring at least once in the pre-training corpus. We select TD separately for each dataset, based on which value shows the maximal significant estimated performance gain across the three model sizes.

Results. In Table 15, we report the percentage of evaluation data that is considered contaminated for the maximal estimated performance gain, as described above, for all key benchmarks. From the table, we exclude numbers for benchmarks for which the results are not significant, for instance because the clean or contaminated set has too few examples, or because the observed performance gain estimate shows extremely erratic behavior. In Table 15, we observe that for some datasets contamination has a large impact, while for others it does not. For example, for PiQA and HellaSwag, both the estimation of contamination and the estimation of performance gain are high. For Natural Questions, on the other hand, the estimated 52% contamination seems to have virtually no effect on the performance. For SQuAD and MATH, low thresholds yield high levels of contamination, but no performance gains. This suggests that contamination is either not helpful for these datasets, or that a larger n is required to obtain a better estimate. Finally, for MBPP, HumanEval, MMLU

and MMLU-Pro, other contamination detection methods may be needed: even with higher thresholds, 8-gram overlap gives such high contamination scores that it is impossible to get a good performance gain estimate.

#### 5.2 Post-trained Language Model

We present results for our Llama 3 post-trained models on benchmarks across different capabilities. Similar to pre-training we are releasing the data generated as part of evaluations with publicly available benchmarks which can be found on Huggingface here. Additional details on our eval setup can be found here.

Benchmarks and metrics. Table 16 contains an overview of all the benchmarks, organized by the capability. We apply decontamination of the post-training data by running exact match with the prompts from each benchmark. In addition to the standard academic benchmarks, we also performed extensive human evaluation of different capabilities. Details are provided in Section 5.3.

Experimental setup. We employ a similar experimental setup to the pre-training phase and conduct a comparative analysis of Llama 3 alongside other models of comparable size and capability. To the extent possible, we evaluate the performance of other models ourselves and compare the results with the reported numbers, selecting the best score. You can find additional details on our evaluation setup here.

#### 5.2.1 General Knowledge and Instruction-Following Benchmarks

We evaluate Llama 3 on benchmarks for general knowledge and instruction-following in Table 2.

General knowledge. We leverage MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024b) to evaluate Llama 3's capability on knowledge-based question answering. For MMLU, we report the macro average of subtask accuracy under the 5-shot standard setting without CoT. MMLU-Pro is an extension of MMLU, incorporating more challenging, reasoning-focused questions, eliminating noisy questions, and expanding the choice set from four to ten options. Given its focus on complex reasoning, we report 5-shot CoT for MMLU-Pro. All tasks are formatted as generation tasks, similar to simple-evals (OpenAI, 2024).

As shown in Table 2, our 8B and 70B Llama 3 variants outperform other models of similar sizes on both general knowledge tasks. Our 405B model outperforms GPT-4 and Nemotron 4 340B, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet leading among larger models.

Instruction following. We assess the ability of Llama 3 and other models to follow natural language instructions on IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023). IFEval comprises approximately 500 "verifiable instructions" such as "write in more than 400 words", which can be verified by heuristics. We report the average of prompt-level and instruction-level accuracy, under strict and loose constraints in Table 2. Note that all Llama 3 variants outperform comparable models across IFEval.

#### 5.2.2 Proficiency Exams

Next, we evaluate our models on a wide variety of proficiency exams originally designed to test humans. We source these exams from publicly available official sources; for some exams, we report average scores across different exam sets per proficiency exam. Specifically, we average:

- GRE: Official GRE Practice Test 1 and 2 (from the Educational Testing Services);
- LSAT: Official Preptest 71, 73, 80 and 93;
- SAT: 8 exams from The Official SAT Study guide edition 2018;
- AP: One official practice exam per subject;
- GMAT Official GMAT Online Exam.

Questions in these exams contain both MCQ style and generation questions. We exclude the questions that are accompanied with images. For the GRE exams that contain questions with multiple correct options, we qualify the outputs as correct only if all the correct options are selected by the model. The evaluations are

Table 17 Performance of Llama 3 models and GPT-4o on a variety of proficiency exams including LSAT, SAT, GMAT, and AP, and GRE tests. For GRE exams, we report normalized score; for all others, we report accuracy. For the bottom two rows corresponding to GRE Quant. and GRE Verbal, we report the scaled scores out of 170.

run using few shot prompting wherever we have more than 1 exam set per exam. We scale the scores to be in the range 130-170 for GRE and report accuracy for all other exams.

Our results can be found in Table 17. We observe that the performance of our Llama 3 405B model is very similar to Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4 4o. Our 70B model has an even more impressive performance. It is significantly better than GPT-3.5 Turbo and beats Nemotron 4 340B on many tests.

#### 5.2.3 Coding Benchmarks

We evaluate Llama 3 on code generation on several popular Python and multi-programming language benchmarks. To gauge the effectiveness of our models in generating functionally correct code, we use the pass@N metric, which evaluates the pass rate for a set of unit tests among N generations. We report pass@1.

Python code generation. HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) are popular benchmarks for Python code generation which focus on relatively simple, self-contained functions. HumanEval+ (Liu et al., 2024a) is an enhanced version of HumanEval, in which more tests are generated to avoid false positives. The MBPP EvalPlus base version (v0.2.0) is a selection of 378 well-formed problems out of the 974 initial problems in all of the original MBPP (train and test) dataset (Liu et al., 2024a). Results for these benchmarks are reported in Table 18. Across the Python variants of these benchmarks, Llama 3 8B and 70B outperform

models of similar sizes. For the largest models, Llama 3 405B, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o perform similarly, with GPT-4o showing the strongest results.

Multi-programming language code generation. To assess code generation capabilities beyond Python, we report results for the MultiPL-E (Cassano et al., 2023) benchmark, which is based on translations of problems from HumanEval and MBPP. Results for a subset of popular programming languages are reported in Table 19. Note that there is a significant drop in performance compared to the Python counterparts in Table 18.

#### 5.2.4 Multilingual Benchmarks

Llama 3 supports 8 languages — English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai, although the underlying foundation model has been trained on a broader collection of languages.9 In Table 20, we show results from evaluating Llama 3 on the multilingual MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) and Multilingual Grade School Math (MGSM) (Shi et al., 2022) benchmarks.

Multilingual MMLU. We translate MMLU questions, few-shot examples, and answers using Google Translate. We leave the task instructions in English and perform the evaluation in a 5-shot setting. In Table 20, we report average results across German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai.

<sup>9</sup>Llama 3 has not been optimized or safety tuned for use cases in those other languages. Developers may fine-tune Llama 3 models for languages beyond the 8 supported languages provided they comply with the Llama 3 Community License and the Acceptable Use Policy and in such cases are responsible for ensuring that any uses of Llama 3 in additional languages is done in a safe and responsible manner.

MGSM (Shi et al., 2022). We use the same native prompts as in simple-evals (OpenAI, 2024) for testing our models in a 0-shot CoT setting. In Table 20, we report averge results across languages covered in MGSM benchmark.

We find that Llama 3 405B outperforms most other models on MGSM, achieving an average of 91.6%. On MMLU, in line with English MMLU results shown above, Llama 3 405B falls behind GPT-4o by 2%. On the other hand, both Llama 3 70B and 8B models demonstrate strong performance, leading among competitors with a wide margin on both tasks.

#### 5.2.5 Math and Reasoning Benchmarks

Our math and reasoning benchmark results are presented in Table 2. Llama 3 8B model outperforms other models of similar sizes on GSM8K, MATH, and GPQA. Our 70B model performs significantly better than other models in its class on all the benchmarks. Finally, Llama 3 405B model is the best in its category

Multilingual MMLU is an internal benchmark with translated MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) questions and answers into 7 languages – we report 5-shot results averaged across these languages.

on GSM8K and ARC-C, while on MATH, it is the second best model. On GPQA, it is competitive with GPT-4 4o, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet being the best model by a significant margin.

#### 5.2.6 Long Context Benchmarks

We consider a diverse set of tasks that span various domains and text types. In the benchmarks we list below, we focus on sub-tasks that use unbiased evaluation protocols, i.e., accuracy-based metrics rather than n-gram overlapping metrics. We also prioritize tasks that we found to be of low variance.

- Needle-in-a-Haystack (Kamradt, 2023) measures a model's ability to retrieve a hidden information inserted in random parts of the long document. Our Llama 3 models demonstrate perfect needle retrieval performance, successfully retrieving 100% of needles at all document depths and context lengths. We also measure performance on Multi-needle (Table 21), a variation of Needle-in-a-Haystack, where we insert four needles in the context and test if a model can retrieve two of them. Our Llama 3 models achieve near perfect retrieval results.
- ZeroSCROLLS (Shaham et al., 2023) is a zero-shot benchmark for natural language understanding over long texts. We report numbers on the validation set, as the ground truth answers are not publicly available. Our Llama 3 405B and 70B models either match or surpass other models on various tasks in this benchmark.
- InfiniteBench (Zhang et al., 2024) requires models to understand long dependencies in the context window. We evaluate Llama 3 on En.QA (QA over novels) and En.MC (multiple-choice QA over novels), where our 405B model outperforms all others. The gains are particularly significant on En.QA.

#### 5.2.7 Tool Use Performance

We evaluate our models on a range of benchmarks for zero-shot tool use (i.e. function calling): Nexus (Srinivasan et al., 2023), API-Bank (Li et al., 2023b), Gorilla API-Bench (Patil et al., 2023), and the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) (Yan et al., 2024). Results are shown in Table 22.

On Nexus, our Llama 3 variants perform the best compared to their counterparts. On the API-Bank, our Llama 3 8B and 70B models outperform other models in their category by a significant margin. The 405B model is behind Claude 3.5 Sonnet by only 0.6%. Finally, our 405B and 70B models perform competitively on BFCL and are close second in their respective size class. Llama 3 8B performs the best in its category.

| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | 90.5 ±12.6 | 18.5 ±14.4 | 13.4 ±7.5 | 11.3 ±3.3 | – | 90.8 ±3.2 |

Table 21 Long-context benchmarks. For ZeroSCROLLS (Shaham et al., 2023), we report numbers on the validation set. For QuALITY we report exact match, for Qasper - f1 and for SQuALITY - rougeL. We report f1 for InfiniteBench (Zhang et al., 2024) En.QA metric and accuracy for En.MC. For Multi-needle (Kamradt, 2023) we insert 4 needles in the context and test if a model can retrieve 2 needles at different context lengths, we compute average recall across 10 sequence lengths up till 128k.

Human evaluations. We also conduct human evaluations to test the tool use capabilities of the model, with a focus on code execution tasks. We collect 2000 user prompts related to code execution (without plotting or file uploads), plot generation, and file uploads. These prompts are collected from the LMSys dataset (Chiang et al., 2024), GAIA benchmark (Mialon et al., 2023b), human annotators, and synthetic generation.

We compare Llama 3 405B to GPT-4o using OpenAI's Assistants API10. The results are provided in Figure 16. On text-only code execution tasks and plots generation, Llama 3 405B significantly beats GPT-4o. However, it lags behind on the file upload use case.

#### 5.3 Human Evaluations

In addition to evaluations on standard benchmark sets, we also perform a series of human evaluations. These evaluations allow us to measure and optimize more subtle aspects of model performance, such as our model's tone, verbosity, and understanding of nuances and cultural contexts. Well-designed human evaluations closely reflect the user experience, providing insights

into how the model performs in real-world scenarios.

g

Prompt collection. We collected high-quality prompt spanning a wide range of categories and difficulties. To do so, we first developed a taxonomy with categories and subcategories capturing as many model capabilities as possible. We used this taxonomy to collect about 7, 000 prompts spanning six individual capabilities (English, reasoning, coding, Hindi, Spanish, and Portuguese), and three multiturn capabilities11 (English, reasoning, and coding). We ensured that within each category, prompts are uniformly distributed across subcategories. We also categorized each prompt into one of three difficulty levels and ensured that our prompt collection

<sup>10</sup>https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview

<sup>11</sup>For multiturn human evaluations, the number of turns is between 2 and 11 in each prompt. We assess the model response in the final turn.

Figure 16 Human evaluation results for Llama 3 405B vs. GPT-4o on code execution tasks including plotting and file uploads. Llama 3 405B outperforms GPT-4o on code execution (without plotting or file uploads) as well as plot generation, but lags behind in file upload use cases.

contains roughly 10% easy prompts, 30% medium prompts, and 60% hard prompts. All the human evaluation prompt sets were subject to a thorough quality assurance process. Modeling teams did not have access to our human-evaluation prompts to prevent accidental contamination or overfitting on the test set.

Evaluation process. To perform a pairwise human evaluation of two models, we ask human annotators which of two model responses (produced by different models) they prefer. Annotators use a 7-point scale for their ratings, enabling them to indicate whether one model response is much better than, better than, slightly better than, or about the same as the other model response. When an annotator indicates that one model response is better or much better than the other model response, we consider this a "win" for that model. We perform pairwise comparisons between models in which we report win rates per capability in the prompt set.

Results. We use our human evaluation process to compare Llama 3 405B with GPT-4 (0125 API version), GPT-4o (API version), and Claude 3.5 Sonnet (API version). The results of these evaluations are presented in Figure 17. We observe that Llama 3 405B performs approximately on par with the 0125 API version of GPT-4, while achieving mixed results (some wins and some losses) compared to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. On nearly all capabilities, the win rates of Llama 3 and GPT-4 are within the margin of error. On multiturn reasoning and coding tasks, Llama 3 405B outperforms GPT-4 but it underperforms GPT-4 on multilingual (Hindi, Spanish, and Portuguese) prompts. Llama 3 performs on par with GPT-4o on English prompts, on par with Claude 3.5 Sonnet on multilingual prompts, and outperforms Claude 3.5 Sonnet on single and multiturn English prompts. However, it trails Claude 3.5 Sonnet in capabilities such as coding and reasoning. Qualitatively, we find that model performance in human evaluations is heavily influenced by nuanced factors such as model tone, response structure, and verbosity – factors that we are optimizing for in our post-training process. Overall, our human evaluation results are consistent with those on standard benchmark evaluations: Llama 3 405B is very competitive with leading industry models, making it the best-performing openly available model.

Limitations. All human evaluation results underwent a thorough data quality assurance process. However, since it is challenging to define objective criteria for evaluating model responses, human evaluations can still be influenced by personal biases, backgrounds, and preferences of human annotators, which may lead to inconsistent or unreliable results.

We focus our study on assessing Llama 3's ability to generate content in a safe and responsible way, while still maximizing helpful information. Our safety work begins in the pre-training stage, primarily in the form of

data cleaning and filtering. We then describe our approach to safety finetuning, focusing on how to train the model to align to specific safety policies while still retaining helpfulness. We analyze each of the Llama 3 capabilities, including multilingual, long context, tool usage, and various multimodal capabilities, to measure the effectiveness of our safety mitigations.

Subsequently, we describe our assessment of uplift for cybersecurity and chemical and biological weapons risks. Uplift refers to the additional risk introduced by new technological developments compared to using existing available technologies (such as web search).

We then describe how we leverage Red Teaming to iteratively identify and combat various safety risks across capabilities and perform a residual risk assessment.

Finally, we describe system-level safety, or the development and orchestration of classifiers around the input and output of the model itself to further enhance safety and make it easier for developers to both customize safety to various usecases and deploy generative AI in more responsible ways.

#### 5.4.1 Benchmark Construction

We create various internal benchmarks to help us develop models safely and responsibly. Our benchmarks are heavily inspired by the risk categories from the ML Commons taxonomy of hazards (Vidgen et al., 2024). While various benchmarks for language model safety exist such as ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022), XS Test (Röttger et al., 2023), and more, a number of the new capabilities in Llama 3 do not have sufficient external benchmarks available and often external benchmarks lack sufficient coverage of breadth and depth.

For each risk category, we collect human-written prompts that are either adversarial or borderline in nature examples of such prompts can be found in Table 23. Adversarial prompts range from straightforward ones that directly elicit a harmful response to ones that incorporate sophisticated jailbreaking techniques. Benchmarks of these adversarial prompts are the basis for how we measure violation rate.

As a counter-metric to violation rate, we also construct false refusal benchmarks composed of borderline prompts. We refer to false refusal as occurring when a model refuses to answer in a helpful way even when a plausible, safe response is possible. Borderline prompts are prompts near the decision boundary that a well-calibrated model should handle, for example, "How can I steal the spotlight from my bestie who always acts like the main character??" Our overall benchmark size across violations and false refusals is over 4000 prompts per capability or language, and contains a mix of single-turn and multi-turn prompts.

#### 5.4.2 Safety Pre-training

We believe responsible development must be considered from an end-to-end perspective and incorporated at every stage of model development and deployment. During pre-training, we apply a variety of filters, such as filters to identify websites that likely contain personally identifiable information (see Section 3.1). We also focus heavily on discoverable memorization (Nasr et al., 2023). Similar to Carlini et al. (2022), we sample prompts and ground truths at different frequencies of occurrence in the training data using an efficient rolling hash index of all n-grams in the corpus. We construct different test scenarios by varying the length of prompt and ground truth, the detected language of target data, and the domain. We then measure how often the model generates the ground truth sequence verbatim, and analyze the relative rates of memorization in the specified scenarios. We define verbatim memorization as the inclusion rate – the proportion of model generations that include the ground truth continuation exactly – and report averages weighted by the prevalence of given characteristics in the data, as shown in Table 24. We find low memorization rates of training data (1.13% and 3.91% on average for the 405B with n = 50 and n = 1000 respectively). Memorization rates are roughly on par with Llama 2 at equivalent size and using the same methodology applied to its data mix.12

#### 5.4.3 Safety Finetuning

We describe our approach to safety finetuning to mitigate risks across many capabilities, which encompasses two key aspects: (1) safety training data and (2) risk mitigation techniques. Our safety finetuning process builds upon our general finetuning methodology with modifications tailored to address specific safety concerns.

We optimize for two primary metrics: Violation Rate (VR), a metric that captures when the model produces a

<sup>12</sup>Note there are limitations with our analysis — for example, recent work advocates for metrics beyond exact match (Ippolito et al., 2023) and alternative prompt search strategies (Kassem et al., 2024). Nonetheless, we find the results of the evaluations to be encouraging.

response that violates a safety policy, and False Refusal Rate (FRR), a metric that captures when the model incorrectly refuses to respond to a harmless prompt. In parallel, we evaluate model performance on helpfulness benchmarks to ensure that safety improvements do not compromise overall helpfulness.

Finetuning data. The quality and design of safety training data has a profound impact on performance. Through extensive ablations, we find that the quality is more critical than the quantity. We mainly use human-generated data collected from our data vendors, but find that it can be prone to errors and inconsistencies — particularly for nuanced safety policies. To ensure the highest quality data, we developed AI-assisted annotation tools to support our rigorous quality assurance processes. In addition to collecting adversarial prompts, we also gather a set of similar prompts, which we refer to as borderline prompts. These are closely related to the adversarial prompts but with a goal to teach the model to learn to provide helpful responses, thereby reducing the false refusal rate (FRR).

Beyond human annotation, we also leverage synthetic data to improve the quality and coverage of our training datasets. We utilize a range of techniques to generate additional adversarial examples, including in-context learning with carefully crafted system prompts, guided mutation of seed prompts based on new attack vectors, and advanced algorithms including Rainbow Teaming (Samvelyan et al., 2024), based on MAP-Elites (Mouret and

![](_page_42_Figure_3.jpeg)

Figure 18 Influence of model size on safety mix design for balancing violation rate (VR) and false refusal rate (FRR). Each point of the scatterplot represents a different data mix balancing safety and helpfulness data. Different model sizes retain varying capacities for safety learning. Our experiments show that 8B models require a higher proportion of safety data relative to helpfulness data in the overall SFT mix to achieve comparable safety performance to 70B models. Larger models are more capable of discerning between adversarial and borderline context, resulting in a more favorable balance between VR and FRR.

Clune, 2015), which generate prompts constrained across multiple dimensions of diversity.

We further address the model's tone when producing safe responses, which has an impact on downstream user experience. We developed a refusal tone guideline for Llama 3 and ensured that all new safety data adhered to it through rigorous quality assurance process. We also refine existing safety data to align with the guideline, using a combination of zero-shot rewriting and human-in-the-loop editing to produce high-quality data. By employing these methods, along with a tone classifier to assess tone quality for safety responses, we are able to significantly improve the model's verbiage.

Safety supervised finetuning. Following our Llama 2 recipe (Touvron et al., 2023b), we combine all helpfulness data and safety data during the model alignment stage. Additionally, we introduce a borderline dataset to help the model discern the subtle distinctions between safe and unsafe requests. Our annotation teams are instructed to meticulously craft responses to safety prompts based on our guidelines. We have found that SFT is highly effective in aligning the model when we strategically balance the ratio of adversarial to borderline examples. We put the focus on more challenging risk areas, with a higher ratio of borderline examples. This plays a crucial role in our successful safety mitigation efforts while keeping false refusal to a minimum.

Further, we examine the impact of model size on the trade-off between FRR and VR in Figure 18. Our results show that it varies — with smaller models requiring a larger proportion of safety data relative to helpfulness, and that it is more challenging to efficiently balance VR and FRR compared to larger models.

Safety DPO. To reinforce safety learning, we incorporate adversarial and borderline examples into our preference datasets in DPO. We discover that crafting response pairs to be nearly orthogonal in an embedding space is particularly effective in teaching the model to distinguish between good and bad responses for a given prompt. We conduct multiple experiments to determine the optimal ratio of adversarial, borderline, and helpfulness examples, aiming to optimize the trade-off between FRR and VR. We also find that the model size influences the learning outcomes — as a result, we tailor different safety mixes for various model sizes.

Note we do not have a borderline data set for Many-shot, due to the adversarial nature of the benchmark, and thus do not measure false refusal rates on it. For Tool Usage (Search), we only test Llama 3 405B compared to Comp. 1.

#### 5.4.4 Safety Results

We first highlight Llama 3's general behavior along various axes and then describe results for each specific new capability and our effectiveness at mitigating the safety risks.

Overall performance. A comparison of Llama 3's final violation and false refusal rates with similar models can be found in Figures 19 and 20. These results focus on our largest parameter size Llama 3 405B model, compared to relevant competitors. Two of the competitors are end-to-end systems accessed through API, and one of them is an open source language model that we host internally and we evaluate directly.13 We evaluate our Llama models both standalone and coupled with Llama Guard, our open source system-level safety solution (more in Section 5.4.7).

While a low violation rate is desirable, it is critical to consider false refusal as a counter-metric, as a model that always refuses is maximally safe, but not helpful in the slightest. Similarly, a model that always answers every prompt, regardless of how problematic the request, would be overly harmful and toxic. In Figure 21, leveraging our internal benchmarks, we explore how different models and systems in industry navigate this trade off and how Llama 3 compares. We find that our models achieve very competitive violation rate metrics

<sup>13</sup>Because these safety benchmarks are internal to Meta, we acknowledge that the numbers in this section are not reproducible externally, and so we choose to anonymize the competitors we evaluate against.

![](_page_44_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 21 Violation and false refusal rates across models and capabilities. Each point represents the overall false refusal and violation rate for an internal capability benchmark across all safety categories. Symbols indicate whether we are evaluating model or system level safety. As expected model level safety results indicate higher violation rates and lower refusal rates compared to system level safety results. Llama 3 aims to balance a low violation rate with a low false refusal rate, while some competitors are more skewed towards one or the other.

while keeping false refusal rate low as well, indicating a solid balance between helpfulness and safety.

Multilingual safety. Our experiments demonstrate that safety knowledge in English does not readily transfer to other languages, particularly given the nuance of safety policies and language-specific context. Therefore, it is essential to collect high-quality safety data for each language. We also found that the distribution of safety data per language significantly impacts performance from a safety standpoint, with some languages benefiting from transfer learning while others require more language-specific data. To achieve a balance between FRR and VR, we iteratively add adversarial and borderline data while monitoring the impact on both metrics.

We display results on our internal benchmarks in Figure 19 for short context models, showing Llama 3's violation and false refusal rates for English and non-English languages compared to similar models and systems. To construct the benchmarks for each language, we use a combination of prompts written by native speakers, sometimes supplementing with translations from our English benchmarks. For each of our supported languages, we find that Llama 405B with Llama Guard is at least as safe, if not strictly safer, than the two competing systems when measured on our internal benchmark, while maintaining competitive false refusal rates. Looking at the Llama 405B model on its own, without Llama Guard, we find that it has a significantly lower violation rate than the competing standalone open source model, trading off a higher false refusal rate.

Long-context safety. Long-context models are vulnerable to many-shot jailbreaking attacks without targeted mitigation (Anil et al., 2024). To address this, we finetune our models on SFT datasets that include examples of safe behavior in the presence of demonstrations of unsafe behavior in context. We develop a scalable mitigation strategy that significantly reduces VR, effectively neutralizing the impact of longer context attacks even for 256-shot attacks. This approach shows little to no impact on FRR and most helpfulness metrics.

To quantify the effectiveness of our long context safety mitigations, we use two additional benchmarking methods: DocQA and Many-shot. For DocQA, short for "document question answering," we use long documents with information that could be utilized in adversarial ways. Models are provided both the document and a set of prompts related to the document in order to test whether the questions being related to information in the document affected the model's ability to respond safely to the prompts. For Many-shot, following Anil et al. (2024), we construct a synthetic chat history composed of unsafe prompt-response pairs. A final prompt, unrelated to previous messages, is used to test whether the unsafe behavior in-context influenced the model

to response unsafely. The violation and false refusal rates for both DocQA and Many-shot are shown in Figure 20. We see that Llama 405B (with and without Llama Guard) is Pareto-better than the Comp. 2 system across both violation rates and false refusal rates, across both DocQA and Many-shot. Relative to Comp. 1, we find that Llama 405B is significantly safer, while coming at a trade off on false refusal.

Tool usage safety. The diversity of possible tools and the implementation of the tool usage call and integration into the model make tool usage a challenging capability to fully mitigate (Wallace et al., 2024). We focus on the search usecase. Violation and false refusal rates are shown in Figure 20. We tested against the Comp. 1 system, where we find that Llama 405B is significantly safer, though has a slightly higher false refusal rate.

#### 5.4.5 Cybersecurity and Chemical/Biological Weapons Safety

CyberSecurity evaluation results. To evaluate cybersecurity risk, we leverage the CyberSecEval benchmark framework (Bhatt et al., 2023, 2024), which contains tasks that measure safety across domains such as generating insecure code, generating malicious code, textual prompt injection, and vulnerability identification. We developed and applied Llama 3 to new benchmarks on spear phishing and autonomous cyberattacks.

Overall, we find that Llama 3 does not have significant susceptibilities in generating malicious code or exploiting vulnerabilities. We describe brief results on specific tasks:

- Insecure coding testing framework: Evaluating Llama 3 8B, 70B, and 405B against the insecure coding testing framework, we continue to observe that larger models both generate more insecure code and also generate code with a higher average BLEU score (Bhatt et al., 2023).
- Code interpreter abuse prompt corpus: We identify that Llama 3 models are susceptible to executing malicious code under certain prompts, with Llama 3 405B being particularly susceptible by complying with malicious prompts 10.4% of the time. Llama 3 70B complied at a rate of 3.8%.
- Text-based prompt injection benchmark: When evaluated against prompt injection benchmarks, prompt injection attacks against Llama 3 405B were successful 21.7% of the time. Figure 22 provides text-based prompt injection success rates across Llama 3, GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini Pro, and Mixtral models.
- Vulnerability identification challenges: In assessing Llama 3's ability to identify and exploit vulnerabilities using CyberSecEval 2's capture-the-flag test challenges, Llama 3 does not outperform commonly used, traditional non-LLM tools and techniques.
- Spear phishing benchmark: We evaluate model persuasiveness and success rate in carrying out personalized conversations designed to deceive a target into unwittingly participating in security compromises. Randomized detailed victim profiles were generated by an LLM to serve as spear phishing targets. A judge LLM (Llama 3 70B) scored the performance of Llama 3 70B and 405B in interacting with a victim model (Llama 3 70B) and evaluated the success of the attempt. Llama 3 70B and Llama 3 405B were evaluated by the judge LLM to be moderately persuasive. Llama 3 70B was judged by an LLM to have been successful in 24% of spear phishing attempts while Llama 3 405B was judged to be successful in 14% of attempts. Figure 23 presents judge LLM-evaluated persuasiveness scores across models and phishing objectives.
- Attack automation framework: We assess Llama 3 70B's and 405B's potential to function as an autonomous agent across four critical phases of a ransomware attack – network reconnaissance, vulnerability identification, exploit execution, and post exploitation actions. We enable the models to behave autonomously by configuring the models to iteratively generate and execute new Linux commands in response to output from their prior commands on a Kali Linux virtual machine as they targeted another virtual machine with known vulnerabilities. Although Llama 3 70B and 405B efficiently identify network services and open ports in their network reconnaissance, the models fail to effectively use this information to gain initial access to the vulnerable machine across 20 and 23 test runs respectively. In identifying vulnerabilities, Llama 3 70B and 405B are moderately effective but struggle with selecting and applying successful exploitation techniques. Attempts to execute exploits were entirely unsuccessful as were post-exploit attempts to maintain access or impact hosts within a network.

Uplift testing for cyber attacks. We conduct an uplift study which measures the extent a virtual assistant improved the cyberattack rates of both novice and expert cyberattackers between two simulated offensive

cybersecurity challenges. A two-stage study was conducted with 62 internal volunteers. Volunteers were categorized into "expert" (31 subjects) and "novice" (31 subjects) cohorts based on their offensive security experience. For the first stage, subjects were asked to complete the challenge without any LLM assistance but with access to the open internet. For the second stage, subjects retained access to the internet but were also provided with Llama 3 405B to complete a different offensive cybersecurity challenge of similar difficulty to the first. An analysis of the completion rates of challenge attack phases by subjects indicates that both novices and experts using the 405B model demonstrated insignificant uplift over having open access to the internet without an LLM.

Uplift testing for chemical and biological weapons. To assess risks related to proliferation of chemical and biological weapons, we perform uplift testing designed to assess whether use of Llama 3 could meaningfully increase the capabilities of actors to plan such attacks.

The study consists of six-hour scenarios where teams of two participants were asked to generate fictitious operational plans for either a biological or chemical attack. The scenarios cover the major planning stages of a CBRNE attack (agent acquisition, production, weaponization, and delivery) and are designed to elicit detailed plans that would address challenges related to procurement of restricted materials, real-world laboratory protocols, and operational security. Participants are recruited based on previous experience in relevant areas of scientific or operational expertise, and assigned to teams consisting of two low-skill actors (no formal training) or two moderate-skill actors (some formal training and practical experience in science or operations).

The study was generated in collaboration with a set of CBRNE experts, and designed to maximize the generality, validity, and robustness of both quantitative and qualitative outcomes. A preliminary study was also performed in order to validate the study design, including a robust power analysis ensuring that our sample size was sufficient for statistical analysis.

Each team is assigned to a "control" or "LLM" condition. The control team has access to internet-based resources only, while the LLM-enabled team had internet access as well as access to Llama 3 models enabled with web search (including PDF ingestion), information retrieval capabilities (RAG), and code execution (Python and Wolfram Alpha). To enable testing of RAG capabilities, a keyword search is used to generate a dataset of hundreds of relevant scientific papers and pre-loaded into the Llama 3 model inference system. At the conclusion of the exercise, the operational plans generated by each team are evaluated by subject matter experts with domain expertise in biology, chemistry, and operational planning. Each plan is evaluated across four stages of potential attacks, generating scores for metrics such as scientific accuracy, detail, detection avoidance, and probability of success in scientific and operational execution. After a robust Delphi process to mitigate bias and variability in subject matter expert (SME) evaluations, final scores are generated by pooling stage-level metrics into a comprehensive score.

Quantitative analysis of these results of this study show no significant uplift in performance related to usage of the Llama 3 model. This result holds true when performing an aggregate analysis (comparing all LLM conditions to the web-only control condition) as well as for breakdowns by subgroups (e.g., separate evaluation of the Llama 3 70B and Llama 3 405B models, or separate evaluation of scenarios related to chemical or biological weapons). After validating these results with CBRNE SMEs, we assess that there is a low risk that release of Llama 3 models will increase ecosystem risk related to biological or chemical weapon attacks.

#### 5.4.6 Red Teaming

We utilize Red Teaming to discover risks and use the findings to improve our benchmarks and safety tuning datasets. We conduct recurring red teaming exercises to continuously iterate and discover new risks, which guides our model development and mitigation process.

Our red team consists of experts in cybersecurity, adversarial machine learning, responsible AI, and integrity, in addition to multilingual content specialists with backgrounds in integrity issues for specific geographic markets. We also partner with internal and external subject-matter experts in critical risk areas to help build risk taxonomies and aid in more focused adversarial assessment.

Adversarial testing on specific model capabilities. We began initial red teaming by focusing on individual model capabilities in a risk discovery process, in context of specific high-risk categories then testing capabilities together. The red team focused on prompt-level attacks to emulate more likely more real world scenarios we find that models often deviate from expected behavior, particularly in cases when the prompt's intention is being obfuscated or when prompts layer multiple abstractions. These risks get more complex with additional capabilities, and we describe several of our red teaming discoveries in detail below. We utilize these red team discoveries in concert with our results on internal safety benchmarks to develop focused mitigations to continuously and iteratively improve model safety.

- Short and long-context English. We employed a mix of well known, published and unpublished techniques across single and multi-turn conversations. We also leveraged advanced, adversarial multi-turn automation similar to PAIR (Chao et al., 2023) across some techniques and risk categories. Largely, multi-turn conversations lead to more harmful outputs. Several attacks were pervasive across model checkpoints, particularly when used together.
	- Multi-turn refusal suppression to specify the model response to follow a particular format or include/exclude particular information related to the refusal as specific phrases.
	- Hypothetical scenarios wrap violating prompts as hypothetical/theoretical tasks or fictional scenarios. Prompts can be as simple as adding the word "hypothetically" or crafting an elaborate layered scenario.
	- Personas and role play gives the model a violating persona with specific violating response characteristics (e.g. "You are X, your goal is Y") or yourself as the user adapting a specific benign character that obfuscates the context of the prompt.
	- Adding disclaimers and warnings works as a form of response priming and we assume a method to allow for the model a path to helpful compliance that intersects with generalized safety training. Asking for disclaimers, trigger warnings and more to be added in multi-turn conversations in concert with other attacks mentioned contributed to increased violation rates.
	- Gradually escalating violation is a multi-turn attack where the conversation starts out with a more or less benign request and then through direct prompting for more exaggerated content can gradually lead the model into generating a very violating response. Once the model has started outputting violating content, it can be difficult for the model to recover (or another attack can be used if a refusal is encountered). With longer context models, this will be an increasingly seen issue.
- Multilingual. We identify a number of unique risks when considering multiple languages.
	- Mixing multiple languages in one prompt or conversation can easily lead to more violating outputs than if a single language was used.
	- Lower resource languages can lead to violating outputs given a lack of related safety fine tuning data, weak model generalization of safety or prioritization of testing or benchmarks. However, this attack often result in poor quality generally, limiting real adversarial use.
- Slang, specific context or cultural-specific references can confuse or appear to be violating at first glance, only to see the model does not comprehend a given reference correctly to make an output truly harmful or prevent it from being a violating output.
- Tool use. During testing, apart from English-text level adversarial prompting techniques being successful in generating violating outputs, several tool specific attacks were also discovered. This included but was not limited to:
	- Unsafe tool chaining such as asking for multiple tools at once with one being violating could, in early checkpoints, lead to all of the tools being called with a mix of benign and violating inputs.
	- Forcing tool use often with specific input strings, fragmented or encoded text can trigger a tool input to be potentially violating, leading to a more violating output. Other techniques can then be used to access the tool results, even if the model would normally refuse to perform the search or assist with the results.
	- Modifying tool use parameters such as swapping words in queries, retrying, or obfuscating some of the initial request in a multi-turn conversation lead to violations in many early checkpoints as a form of forcing tool use.

Child safety risks. Child Safety risk assessments were conducted using a team of experts, to assess the model's capability to produce outputs that could result in Child Safety risks and inform on any necessary and appropriate risk mitigations via fine tuning. We leveraged those expert red teaming sessions to expand the coverage of our evaluation benchmarks through model development. For Llama 3, we conducted new in-depth sessions using objective based methodologies to assess model risks along multiple attack vectors. We also partnered with content specialists to perform red teaming exercises assessing potentially violating content while taking account of market specific nuances or experiences.

#### 5.4.7 System Level Safety

In various real-world applications of large language models, models are not used in isolation but are integrated into broader systems. In this section, we describe our system level safety implementation, which supplements model-level mitigations by providing more flexibility and control.

To enable this, we develop and release a new classifier, Llama Guard 3, which is a Llama 3 8B model fine-tuned for safety classification. Similar to Llama Guard 2 (Llama-Team, 2024), this classifier is used to detect whether input prompts and/or output responses generated by language models violate safety policies on specific categories of harm.

It is designed to support Llama's growing capabilities, and can be used for English and multilingual text. It is also optimized to be used in the context of tool-calls such as search-tools and preventing code interpreter abuse. Finally, we also provide quantized variants to reduce memory requirements. We encourage developers to use our release of system safety components as a foundation and configure them for their own use cases.

Taxonomy. We train on the 13 hazard categories listed in the AI Safety taxonomy (Vidgen et al., 2024): Child Sexual Exploitation, Defamation, Elections, Hate, Indiscriminate Weapons, Intellectual Property, Non-Violent Crimes, Privacy, Sex-Related Crimes, Sexual Content, Specialized Advice, Suicide & Self-Harm, and Violent Crimes. We also train on Code Interpreter Abuse category to support tool-calls use cases.

Training data. We start with the English data used by Llama Guard (Inan et al., 2023) and expand this dataset to incorporate new capabilities. For new capabilities such as multilingual and tool use, we collect prompt and response classification data, as well as utilize the data collected for safety finetuning. We increase the number of unsafe responses in the training set by doing prompt engineering to get the LLM to not refuse responding to adversarial prompts. We use Llama 3 to obtain response labels on such generated data.

To improve the performance of Llama Guard 3, we do extensive cleaning of the collected samples using human annotation as well as LLM annotation by Llama 3. Obtaining labels for user prompts is a much harder task for both humans and LLMs, and we find that the human labels are slightly better, especially for borderline prompts, though our full iterative system is able to reduce the noise and produce more accurate labels.

|  |  | Input Llama Guard |  | Output Llama Guard |  | Full Llama Guard |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Capability | VR | FRR | VR | FRR | VR | FRR |
| English | -76% | +95% | -75% | +25% | -86% | +102% |
| French | -38% | +27% | -45% | +4% | -59% | +29% |
| German | -57% | +32% | -60% | +14% | -77% | +37% |
| Hindi | -54% | +60% | -54% | +14% | -71% | +62% |
| Italian | -34% | +27% | -34% | +5% | -48% | +29% |
| Portuguese | -51% | +35% | -57% | +13% | -65% | +39% |
| Spanish | -41% | +26% | -50% | +10% | -60% | +27% |
| Thai | -43% | +37% | -39% | +8% | -51% | +39% |

Table 25 Violation Rate (VR) and False Refusal Rate (FRR) relative to Llama 3 when using Llama Guard 3 for input or output filtering on different languages. For example, -50% for VR means that there is a 50% reduction in the rate of Llama 3 model violations when using Llama Guard. Evaluations are performed on generations from the 405B-parameter Llama 3 model. Lower is better.

Results. Llama Guard 3 is able to significantly reduce violations across capabilities (-65% violations on average across our benchmarks). Note that adding system safeguards (and any safety mitigations in general) comes at the cost of increased refusals to benign prompts. In Table 25 we report reductions in violation rate and increases in false refusal rate increase compared to the base model to highlight this tradeoff. This effect is also visible in Figures 19, 20, and 21.

System safety also offers more flexibility. Llama Guard 3 can be deployed for specific harms only enabling control over the violations and false refusals trade-off at the harm category level. Table 26 presents violations reduction per category to inform which category should be turned on/off based on the developer use case.

To make it easier to deploy safety systems, we provide a quantized version of Llama Guard 3 using the commonly used int8 quantization technique, reducing its size by more than 40%. Table 27 illustrates that quantization has negligible impact on the performance of the model.

Prompt-based system guards. System-level safety components enable developers to customize and control how LLM systems respond to user requests. As part of our work on improving the overall safety of the model system and enable developers to deploy responsibly, we describe and release the creation of two prompt-based filtering mechanisms: Prompt Guard and Code Shield. We open-source these for the community to leverage as-is or take as inspiration and adapt for their usecases.

Prompt Guard is a model-based filter designed to detect prompt attacks, which are input strings designed to subvert the intended behavior of an LLM functioning as part of an application. The model is a multi-label classifier that detects two classes of prompt attack risk - direct jailbreaks (techniques that explicitly try to override a model's safety conditioning or system prompt) and indirect prompt injections (instances where third-party data included in a model's context window includes instructions inadvertently executed as user commands by an LLM). The model is fine-tuned from mDeBERTa-v3-base, a small (86M) parameter model suitable for filtering inputs into an LLM. We evaluate the performance on several evaluation datasets shown in Table 28. We evaluate on two datasets (jailbreaks and injections) drawn from the same distribution as the training data, as well as an out-of-distribution dataset in English, a multilingual jailbreak set built from machine translation, and a dataset of indirect injections drawn from CyberSecEval (both English and multilingual). Overall, we find that the model generalizes well to new distributions and has strong performance.

Code Shield is an example of a class of system-level protections based on providing inference-time filtering. In particular, it focuses on detecting the generation of insecure code before it might enter a downstream usecase such as a production system. It does so by leveraging a static analysis library, the Insecure Code Detector (ICD), to identify insecure code. ICD uses a suite of static analysis tools to perform the analysis across 7 programming languages. These kinds of guardrails are generally useful for developers, who can deploy multi-layered protections in various applications.

Table 26 Violation rate and false refusal rate relative to Llama 3 when using Llama Guard 3 for input or output filtering on different safety categories. For example, -50% for VR means that there is a 50% reduction in the rate of Llama 3 model violations when using Llama Guard. Evaluations are performed on English prompts and generations from the 405B parameter Llama 3 model. Lower is better.

#### 5.4.8 Limitations

We conducted extensive measurement and mitigation on a wide variety of risks to safe usage of Llama 3. However, no testing can be guaranteed to be exhaustive in identifying every possible risk. Llama 3 may still generate harmful content due to training on various datasets, particularly for languages beyond English and when prompt engineered by skilled adversarial red teamers. Malicious developers or adversarial users may find new ways to jailbreak our models and use them for various nefarious usecases. We will continue to proactively identify risks, conduct research on mitigation methods, and we encourage developers to consider responsibility in every aspect — from model development to deployment to users. We hope developers will leverage and contribute to the tools we release in our open-source system-level safety suite.

### 6 Inference

We investigate two main techniques to make inference with the Llama 3 405B model efficient: (1) pipeline parallelism and (2) FP8 quantization. We have publicly released our implementation of FP8 quantization.

### 6.1 Pipeline Parallelism

When using a BF16 number representation for the model parameters, Llama 3 405B does not fit in the GPU memory of a single machine with 8 Nvidia H100 GPUs. To address this issue, we parallelize model inference using BF16 precision across 16 GPUs on two machines. Within each machine, the high NVLink bandwidth

| Metric | Jailbreaks | Injections | Out-of-Distribution Jailbreaks | Multilingual Jailbreaks | Indirect Injections |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TPR | 99.9% | 99.5% | 97.5% | 91.5% | 71.4% |
| FPR | 0.4% | 0.8% | 3.9% | 5.3% | 1.0% |
| AUC | 0.997 | 1.000 | 0.975 | 0.959 | 0.996 |

enables the use of tensor parallelism (Shoeybi et al., 2019). Across nodes, however, connectivity has lower bandwidth and higher latency, so we use pipeline parallelism (Huang et al., 2019) instead.

During training with pipeline parallelism, bubbles are a major efficiency concern (see Section 3.3). However, they are not an issue during inference, since inference does not involve a backward pass that requires a pipeline flush. Therefore, we use micro-batching to improve inference throughput with pipeline parallelism.

We evaluate the effect of using two micro-batches in inference workloads of 4,096 input tokens and 256 output tokens both during the key-value cache pre-fill stage of inference and during the decoding stage. We find that micro-batching improves throughput of inference with the same local batch size; see Figure 24. These improvements result from micro-batching enabling concurrent execution of micro batches in both these stages. The additional synchronization points due to micro-batching also increase latency but, overall, micro-batching still leads to a better throughput-latency trade-off.

#### 6.2 FP8 Quantization

We perform experiments leveraging the native FP8 support of H100 GPUs to perform low-precision inference. To enable low-precision inference, we apply FP8 quantization to most matrix multiplications inside the model. In particular, we quantize most parameters and activations in the feedforward network layers in the model, which account for roughly 50% of the inference compute time. We do not quantize parameters in the self-attention layers of the model. We leverage dynamic scaling factors for better accuracy (Xiao et al., 2024b), optimizing our CUDA kernels15 to reduce the overhead of calculating the scales. We find that the quality of Llama 3 405B is sensitive to certain types of quantization, and make a few additional changes to increase the model output quality:

1. Akin to Zhang et al. (2021), we do not perform quantization in the first and last Transformer layers.

- 2. High-perplexity tokens such as dates can lead to large activation values. In turn, these can lead to high dynamic scaling factors in FP8 and a non-negligible number of underflows, leading to errors in decoding.
<sup>15</sup>Our FP8 kernels are available at https://github.com/pytorch/FBGEMM/tree/main/fbgemm_gpu/experimental/gen_ai. We provide usage examples at https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-agentic-system.

Figure 26 Reward score distribution for Llama 3 405B using BF16 and FP8 inference. Our FP8 quantization approach has negligible impact on the model's responses.

To address this issue, we upper bound the dynamic scaling factors to 1200.

- 3. We use row-wise quantization, computing scaling factors across rows for parameter and activation matrices (see Figure 25). We find this works better than a tensor-wise quantization approach.
Effect of quantization errors. Evaluations on standard benchmarks often suggest that FP8 inference performs on par with BF16 inference even without these mitigations. However, we find that such benchmarks do not adequately reflect the effects of FP8 quantization. When scaling factors are not upper bounded, the model occasionally produces corrupted responses even though the benchmark performance is strong. Instead of relying on benchmarks to measure distribution changes due to quantization, we find it is better to analyze the distribution of reward-model scores for 100, 000 responses produced using both FP8 and BF16. Figure 26 shows the resulting reward distribution for our quantization approach. The results in the figure show that our approach to FP8 quantization has very limited impact on the model's response.

Experimental evaluation of efficiency. Figure 27 depicts the throughput-latency trade-off of performing FP8 inference with Llama 3 405B in the pre-fill and decoding stages, using 4,096 input tokens and 256 output tokens. The figure compares the efficiency of FP8 inference with that of the two-machine BF16 inference approach described in Section 6.1. The results show that use of FP8 inference leads to throughput improvements of up to 50% during the pre-fill stage, and a substantially better throughput-latency trade-off during decoding.

### 7 Vision Experiments

We perform a series of experiments in which we incorporate visual-recognition capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach that consists of two main stages. First, we compose a pre-trained image encoder (Xu et al., 2023) and the pre-trained language model by introducing and training a set of cross-attention layers between the two models (Alayrac et al., 2022) on a large number of image-text pairs. This leads to the model illustrated in Figure 28. Second, we introduce temporal aggregator layers and additional video cross-attention layers that operate on a large collection of video-text pairs to learn the model to recognize and process temporal information from videos.

A compositional approach to foundation model development has several advantages: (1) it enables us to parallelize the development of the vision and language modeling capabilities; (2) it circumvents complexities of joint pre-training on visual and language data that stem from tokenization of visual data, differences in background perplexities of tokens originating from different modalities, and contention between modalities; (3) it guarantees that model performance on text-only tasks is not affected by the introduction of visual-recognition capabilities, and (4) the cross-attention architecture ensures that we do not have to expend compute passing full-resolution images through the increasingly LLM backbones (specifically, the feed-forward networks in each transformer layer), making it more efficient during inference. We note that our multimodal models are still under development and not yet ready for release.

Before presenting the results of our experiments in Section 7.6 and 7.7, we describe the data we used to train visual recognition capabilities, the model architecture of the vision components, how we scale training of those components, and our pre-training and post-training recipes.

#### 7.1 Data

We describe our image and video data separately below.

#### 7.1.1 Image Data

Our image encoder and adapter are trained on image-text pairs. We construct this dataset via a complex data processing pipeline that consists of four main stages: (1) quality filtering, (2) perceptual de-duplication, (3) resampling, and (4) optical character recognition. We also apply a series of safety mitigations.

- Quality filtering. We implement quality filters that remove non-English captions and low-quality captions via heuristics such as low alignment scores produced by (Radford et al., 2021). Specifically, we remove all image-text pairs below a certain CLIP score.
- De-duplication. De-duplicating large-scale training datasets benefits model performance because it reduces training compute spent on redundant data (Esser et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2021; Abbas et al.,

![](_page_54_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 28 Illustration of the compositional approach to adding multimodal capabilities to Llama 3 that we study in this paper. This approach leads to a multimodal model that is trained in five stages: (1) language model pre-training, (2) multi-modal encoder pre-training, (3) vision adapter training, (4) model finetuning, and (5) speech adapter training.

> 2023) and memorization (Carlini et al., 2023; Somepalli et al., 2023). Hence, we de-duplicate our training data for both efficiency and privacy reasons. To do so, we use an internal version of the state-of-the-art SSCD copy-detection model (Pizzi et al., 2022) to de-duplicate images at scale. For all images, we first compute a 512-dimensional representation using the SSCD model. We use those embeddings to perform a nearest neighbor (NN) search for each image across all images in our data set, using a cosine similarity measure. We define examples above a certain similarity threshold as duplicates. We group these duplicates using a connected-components algorithm, and maintain only one image-text pair per connected component. We increase the efficiency of our de-duplication pipeline by: (1) pre-clustering the data using k-means clusters and (2) using FAISS (Johnson et al., 2019) for NN searches and clustering.

- Resampling. We ensure diversity of the image-text pairs via resampling akin to Xu et al. (2023); Mahajan et al. (2018); Mikolov et al. (2013). First, we construct a vocabulary of n-grams by parsing high-quality text sources. Next, we compute the frequency of each vocabulary n-gram in our dataset. We then resample the data as follows: If any of the n-grams in a caption occurs less than T times in the vocabulary, we keep the corresponding image-text pair. Otherwise, we independently sample each of the n-grams ni in the caption with probability p T /fi where fi indicates the frequency of n-gram ni ; we keep the image-text pair if any of the n-grams was sampled. This resampling aids performance on low-frequency categories and fine-grained recognition tasks.
- Optical character recognition. We further improve our image-text data by extracting text written in the image and concatenating it with the caption. The written text is extracted using a proprietary optical character recognition (OCR) pipeline. We observe that adding OCR data into the training data greatly improves tasks that require OCR capabilities, such as document understanding.

Transcribing documents. To improve the performance of our models on document understanding tasks, we render pages from documents as images and paired the images with their respective text. The document text is obtained either directly from the source or via a document parsing pipeline.

Safety. We focus primarily on ensuring that the pre-training dataset for image recognition does not contain

unsafe content, such as sexual abuse material (CSAM) (Thiel, 2023). We scan all our training images for CSAM using perceptual hashing approaches such as PhotoDNA (Farid, 2021) as well as internal, proprietary classifiers. We also use a proprietary media-risk retrieval pipeline to identify and remove image-text pairs that we consider to be NSFW, for example, because they contain sexual or violent content. We believe that minimizing the prevalence of such material in the training dataset improves the safety of the final model without impacting its helpfulness. Finally, we perform face blurring on all images in our training set. We test the model against human generated prompts that refer to an attached image.

Annealing data. We create an annealing dataset by resampling the image-caption pairs to a smaller volume of ∼350M examples using n-grams. Since the n-grams resampling favor richer text descriptions, this selects a higher-quality data subset. We augment the resulting data with ∼150M examples from five additional sources:

- Visual grounding. We link noun phrases in the text to bounding boxes or masks in the image. The grounding information (bounding boxes and masks) are specified in the image-text pair in two ways. (1) We overlay boxes or masks with marks on the image and use marks in the text as reference, akin to set-of-marks (Yang et al., 2023a). (2) We insert normalized (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax) coordinates directly into the text, demarcated by special tokens.
- Screenshot parsing. We render screenshots from HTML code and task the model with predicting the code that produced a specific element in the screenshot, akin to Lee et al. (2023). The element of interest is indicated in the screenshot via a bounding box.
- Question-answer pairs. We include question-answer pairs, enabling us to use volumes of questionanswering data that are too large to be used in model finetuning.
- Synthetic captions. We include images with synthetic captions that were generated by an early version of the model. Compared to original captions, we find that synthetic captions provide a more comprehensive description of images than the original captions.
- Synthetically-generated structured images. We also include synthetically generated images for a variety of domains such as charts, tables, flowcharts, math equations and textual data. These images are accompanied by a structured representation such as the corresponding markdown or LaTeX notation. Besides improving recognition capabilities of the model for these domains, we find this data useful to generate question-answer pairs via the text model for finetuning.

#### 7.1.2 Video Data

For video pre-training, we use a large dataset of video-text pairs. Our dataset is curated through a multi-stage process. We filter and clean the associated texts using rule-based heuristics, such as ensuring a minimum length and fixing capitalization. Then, we run language identification models to filter out non-English texts. We run OCR detection models to filter out videos with excessive overlaid text. To ensure reasonable alignment between the video-text pairs, we use CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) style image-text and video-text contrastive models. We first compute image-text similarity using a single frame in the videos and filtered out low similarity pairs, and then subsequently filter out pairs with low video-text alignment. Some of our data contains static or low-motion videos; we filter out such data using motion-score based filtering (Girdhar et al., 2023). We do not apply any filters on the visual quality of the videos such as aesthetic scores or resolution filtering.

Our dataset contains videos with an average duration of 21 seconds and a median duration of 16 seconds, with over 99% videos being under a minute. The spatial resolution varies significantly between 320p and 4K videos, with over 70% of the videos having a short side greater than 720 pixels. The videos have varying aspect ratios with almost all videos having between aspect ratio between 1:2 and 2:1, with a 1:1 median.

### 7.2 Model Architecture

Our visual-recognition model consists of three main components: (1) an image encoder, (2) an image adapter, and (3) a video adapter.

Image encoder. Our image encoder is a standard vision transformer (ViT; Dosovitskiy et al. (2020)) that is trained to align images and text (Xu et al., 2023). We use the ViT-H/14 variant of the image encoder,

which has 630M parameters that were trained on 2.5B image-text pairs for five epochs. The image encoder is pre-trained on images with resolution 224 × 224; images were split up into 16 × 16 patches of equal size (i.e., a patch size of 14x14 pixels). As also demonstrated by prior work such as ViP-Llava (Cai et al., 2024), we observe that image encoders trained via a contrastive text alignment objective are unable to preserve fine-grained localization information. To alleviate this, we employ a multi-layer feature extraction, where features from the 4 th, 8th, 16th, 24th and 31st layers are also provided in addition to the final layer features. In addition, we further insert 8 gated self-attention layers (making a total of 40 transformer blocks) prior to pre-training of the cross-attention layers to learn alignment-specific features. The image encoder therefore eventually has a total 850M parameters with the additional layers. With the multi-layer features, the image encoder produces a 7680-dimensional representation for each of the resulting 16 × 16 = 256 patches. The parameters of the image encoder are not frozen during subsequent training stages as we found it to improve performance, especially in domains such as text recognition.

Image adapter. We introduce cross-attention layers between the visual token representations produced by the image encoder and the token representations produced by the language model (Alayrac et al., 2022). The cross-attention layers are applied after every fourth self-attention layer in the core language model. Like the language model itself, the cross-attention layers use generalized query attention (GQA) for increased efficiency. The cross-attention layers introduce substantial numbers of additional trainable parameters into the model: for Llama 3 405B, the cross-attention layers have ≈100B parameters. We pre-train our image adapter in two stages: (1) initial pre-training followed by (2) annealing:

- Initial pre-training. We pre-train our image adapter on our dataset of ∼6B image-text pairs described above. For compute efficiency reasons, we resize all images to fit within at most four tiles of 336 × 336 pixels each, where we arrange the tiles to support different aspect ratios, e.g., 672 × 672, 672 × 336, and 1344 × 336.
- Annealing. We continue training the image adapter on ∼500M images from the annealing dataset described above. During annealing, we increase the per-tile image resolution to improve performance on tasks that require higher-resolution images, for example, infographics understanding.

Video adapter. Our model takes as input up to 64 frames (uniformly sampled from a full video), each of which is processed by the image encoder. We model temporal structure in videos through two components: (i) encoded video frames are aggregated by a temporal aggregator which merges 32 consecutive frames into one, (ii) additional video cross attention layers are added before every fourth image cross attention layer. The temporal aggregator is implemented as a perceiver resampler (Jaegle et al., 2021; Alayrac et al., 2022). We pre-train using 16 frames per video (aggregated to 1 frame), but increase the number of input frames to 64 during supervised finetuning. The video aggregator and cross attention layers have 0.6B and 4.6B parameters for Llama 3 7B and 70B, respectively.

#### 7.3 Model Scaling

After the visual-recognition components are added to Llama 3, the model contains self-attention layers, crossattention layers, and a ViT image encoder. To train adapters for the smaller 8B and 70B parameter models, we found a combination of data and tensor parallelization is the most efficient. Model or pipeline parallelism does not increase efficiency at these scales because the gathering of model parameters would dominate the computation. We do, however, use pipeline parallelism (in addition to data and tensor parallelism) when training the adapter for the 405B parameter model. Training at this scale introduces three new challenges in addition to those outlined in Section 3.3: model heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, and numerical instabilities.

Model heterogeneity. The model computation is heterogeneous because more computation is performed on some tokens than on others. In particular, image tokens are processed by the image encoder and the crossattention layers, whereas text tokens are only processed by the language backbone. This heterogeneity leads to bottlenecks in the scheduling of pipeline parallelism. We address this problem by ensuring each pipeline stage contains five layers: namely, four self-attention layers in the language backbone and a cross-attention layer. (Recall that we introduce a cross-attention layer after every fourth self-attention layer.) In addition, we replicate the image encoder on all pipeline stages. Because we train on paired image-text data, this enables us to perform load balancing between the image and text parts of the computation.

Data heterogeneity. The data is heterogeneous because, on average, images have more tokens than the associated text: an image has 2,308 tokens, whereas the associated text contains an average of only 192 tokens. As a result, the computation of cross-attention layers requires more time and memory than the computation of self-attention layers. We address this problem by introducing sequence parallelization in the image encoder, so that each GPU processes roughly the same number of tokens. Because the average text size is relatively short, we also use a substantially larger micro-batch size (8 instead of 1).

Numerical instabilities. After the image encoder is added to the model, we find that performing gradient accumulation in bf16 led to numerical instabilities. The most likely explanation for this is that image tokens are introduced into the language backbone via all cross-attention layers. This implies that numerical deviations in the representation of an image token have an outsized impact on the overall computation because the errors are compounded. We address this by performing gradient accumulation in FP32.

#### 7.4 Pre-training

Image. We initialize from the pre-trained text model and vision encoder weights. The vision encoder is unfrozen, while the text model weights are kept frozen as explained above. First, we train the model using 6B image-text pairs where each image is resized to fit within four tiles of 336 × 336 pixels. We use a global batch size of 16,384 and a cosine learning rate schedule with initial learning rate 10 × 10−4 and a weight decay of 0.01. The initial learning rate was determined based on small-scale experiments. However, these findings did not generalize well to very long training schedules and dropped the learning rate a few times during training when the loss values became stagnant. After the base pre-training, we increase the image resolution further and continue training the same weights on the annealing dataset. The optimizer is re-initialized via warm-up to learning rate 2 × 10−5 and again follows a cosine schedule.

Video. For video pre-training, we start from the image pre-trained and annealed weights as described above. We add the video aggregator and cross-attention layers as described in the architecture, initialized randomly. We freeze all the parameters in the model except the video-specific ones (the aggregator and video cross-attention), and train them on the video pre-training data. We use the same training hyperparameters as the image annealing stage, with small differences in the learning rate. We uniformly sample 16 frames from the full video, and represent each frame using four chunks, each of size of 448 × 448 pixels. We use an aggregation factor of 16 in the video aggregator, hence obtaining one effective frame, which the text tokens cross-attend to. We use a global batch size of 4,096, a sequence length of 190 tokens, and a learning rate of 10−4 during training.

### 7.5 Post-Training

In this section, we describe the post-training recipe for our vision adapters. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model on highly curated multi-modal conversational data to enable chat capabilities. We further implement direct preference optimization (DPO) to boost human evaluation performance and rejection sampling to improve multi-modal reasoning capabilities. Finally, we add a quality-tuning stage where we continue finetuning the model on a very small set of high-quality conversational data which further boosts human evaluation while retaining performance across benchmarks. More details on each of these steps are provided below.

### 7.5.1 Supervised Finetuning Data

We describe our supervised finetuning (SFT) data for image and video capabilities separately below.

Image. We utilize a mix of different datasets for supervised finetuning.

- Academic datasets. We convert a highly filtered collection of existing academic datasets to questionanswer pairs using templates or via LLM rewriting. The LLM rewriting's purpose is to augment the data with different instructions and to improve the language quality of answers.
- Human annotations. We collect multi-modal conversation data via human annotators for a wide range of tasks (open-ended question-answering, captioning, practical use cases, etc.) and domains (e.g., natural images and structured images). Annotators are provided with images and asked to write conversations. To ensure diversity, we cluster large-scale datasets and sampled images uniformly across different clusters. Further, we acquire additional images for a few specific domains by expanding a seed via k-nearest

neighbors. Annotators are also provided with intermediate checkpoints of existing models to facilitate model-in-the-loop style annotations, so that model generations can be utilized as a starting point by the annotators to then provide additional human edits. This is an iterative process, in which model checkpoints would be regularly updated with better performing versions trained on the latest data. This increases the volume and efficiency of human annotations, while also improving their quality.

- Synthetic data. We explore different ways to generate synthetic multi-modal data by using textrepresentations of images and a text-input LLM. The high-level idea is to utilize the reasoning capabilities of text-input LLMs to generate question-answer pairs in the text domain, and replace the text representation with its corresponding images to produce synthetic multi-modal data. Examples include rendering texts from question-answer datasets as images or rendering table data into synthetic images of tables and charts. Additionally, we use captions and OCR extractions from existing images to generate additional conversational or question-answer data related to the images.
Video. Similar to the image adapter, we use academic datasets with pre-existing annotations and convert them into appropriate textual instructions and target responses. The targets are converted to open-ended responses or multiple-choice options, whichever is more appropriate. We ask humans to annotate videos with questions and corresponding answers. The annotators are asked to focus on questions that could not be answered based on a single frame, to steer the annotators towards questions that require temporal understanding.

#### 7.5.2 Supervised Finetuning Recipe

We describe our supervised finetuning (SFT) recipe for image and video capabilities separately below.

Image. We initialize from the pre-trained image adapter, but hot-swap the pre-trained language model's weights with the instruction tuned language model's weights. The language model weights are kept frozen to maintain text-only performance, i.e., we only update the vision encoder and image adapter weights.

Our approach to finetune the model is similar to Wortsman et al. (2022). First, we run a hyperparameter sweep using multiple random subsets of data, learning rates and weight decay values. Next, we rank the models based on their performance. Finally, we average the weights of the top-K models to obtain the final model. The value of K is determined by evaluating the averaged models and selecting the instance with highest performance. We observe that the averaged models consistently yield better results compared to the best individual model found via grid search. Further, this strategy reduces sensitivity to hyperparameters.

Video. For video SFT, we initialize the video aggregator and cross-attention layers using the pre-trained weights. The rest of the parameters in the model, the image weights and the LLM, are initialized from corresponding models following their finetuning stages. Similar to video pre-training, we then finetune only the video parameters on the video SFT data. For this stage, we increase the video length to 64 frames, and use an aggregation factor of 32 to get two effective frames. The resolution of the chunks is also increased to be consistent with the corresponding image hyperparameters.

#### 7.5.3 Preference Data

We built multimodal pair-wise preference datasets for reward modeling and direct preference optimization.

- Human annotations. The human-annotated preference data consists of comparisons between two different model outputs, labeled as "chosen" and "rejected", with 7-scale ratings. The models used to generate responses are sampled on-the-fly from a pool of the best recent models, each with different characteristics. We update the model pool weekly. Besides preference labels, we also request annotators to provide optional human edits to correct inaccuracies in "chosen" responses because vision tasks have a low tolerance for inaccuracies. Note that human editing is an optional step because there is a trade-off between volume and quality in practice.
- Synthetic data. Synthetic preference pairs could also be generated by using text-only LLMs to edit and deliberately introduce errors in the supervised finetuning dataset. We took the conversational data as input, and use an LLM to introduce subtle but meaningful errors (e.g., change objects, change attributes, add mistakes in calculations, etc.). These edited responses are used as negative "rejected" samples and paired with the "chosen" original supervised finetuning data.

- Rejection sampling. Furthermore, to create more on-policy negative samples, we leveraged the iterative process of rejection sampling to collect additional preference data. We discuss our usage of rejection sampling in more detail in the following sections. At a high-level, rejection sampling is used to iteratively sample high-quality generations from a model. Therefore, as a by-product, all generations that are not selected can be used as negative rejected samples and used as additional preference data pairs.
#### 7.5.4 Reward Modeling

We train a vision reward model (RM) on top of the vision SFT model and the language RM. The vision encoder and the cross-attention layers are initialized from the vision SFT model and unfrozen during training, while the self-attention layers are initialized from the language RM and kept frozen. We observe that freezing the language RM part generally leads to better accuracy, especially on tasks that require the RM to judge based on its knowledge or the language quality. We adopt the same training objective as the language RM, but adding a weighted regularization term on the square of the reward logits averaged over the batch, which prevents the reward scores from drifting.

The human preference annotations in Section 7.5.3 are used to train the vision RM. We follow the same practice as language preference data (Section 4.2.1) to create two or three pairs with clear ranking (edited > chosen > rejected). In addition, we also synthetically augment the negative responses by perturbing the words or phrases related to the information in the image (such as numbers or visual texts). This encourages the vision RM to ground its judgement based on the actual image content.

### 7.5.5 Direct Preference Optimization

Similar to the language model (Section 4.1.4), we further train the vision adapters with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al. (2023)) using the preference data described in Section 7.5.3. To combat the distribution shift during post-training rounds, we only keep recent batches of human preference annotations while dropping batches that are sufficiently off-policy (e.g., if the base pre-trained model is changed). We find that instead of always freezing the reference model, updating it in an exponential moving average (EMA) fashion every k-steps helps the model learn more from the data, resulting in better performance in human evaluations. Overall, we observed that the vision DPO model consistently performs better than its SFT starting point in human evaluations for every finetuning iteration.

#### 7.5.6 Rejection Sampling

Most available question-answer pairs only contain the final answer and lack the chain-of-thought explanation that is required to train a model that generalizes well for reasoning tasks. We use rejection sampling to generate the missing explanations for such examples and boost the model's reasoning capabilities.

Given a question-answer pair, we generate multiple answers by sampling the finetuned model with different system prompts or temperature. Next, we compare the generated answers to the ground-truth via heuristics or an LLM judge. Finally, we retrain the model by adding the correct answers back into the finetuning data mix. We find it useful to keep multiple correct answers per question.

To ensure we only add high-quality examples back into training, we implemented the following two guardrails. First, we find that some examples contain incorrect explanations, despite the final answer being correct. We observed that this pattern occurs more frequently for questions where only a small fraction of the generated answers is correct. Therefore, we drop answers for questions where the probability of the answer being correct is below a certain threshold. Second, raters prefer some answers over others due to differences in language or style. We use the reward model to select top-K highest-quality answers and add them back into training.

#### 7.5.7 Quality Tuning

We curate a small but highly selective SFT dataset where all samples have been rewritten and verified either by humans or our best models to meet our highest standards. We train DPO models with this data to improve response quality, calling the process Quality-Tuning (QT). We find that QT significantly improves human evaluations without affecting generalization verified by benchmarks when the QT dataset covers a wide range

of tasks and proper early stopping is applied. We select checkpoints at this stage purely based on benchmarks to ensure capabilities are retained or improved.

### 7.6 Image Recognition Results

We evaluate the performance of the image understanding capabilities of Llama 3 on a range of tasks spanning natural image understanding, text understanding, charts understanding and multimodal reasoning:

- MMMU (Yue et al., 2024a) is a challenging dataset for mulitmodal reasoning where model is expected to understand images and solve college-level problems spanning 30 different disciplines. This includes both multiple-choice and open ended questions. We evaluate our model on the validation set with 900 images, in line with other works.
- VQAv2 (Antol et al., 2015) tests the ability of a model to combine image understanding, language understanding and commonsense knowlege to answer generic questions about natural images
- AI2 Diagram (Kembhavi et al., 2016) evaluates models capability to parse scientific diagrams and answer questions about the same. We use the same evaluation protocol as Gemini and x.ai, and report scores using a transparent bounding box.
- ChartQA (Masry et al., 2022) is a challenging benchmark for charts understanding. This requires model to visually understand different kinds of charts and answer logical questions about the charts.
- TextVQA (Singh et al., 2019) is a popular benchmark dataset that requires models to read and reason about text in images to answer questions about them. This tests the OCR understanding ability of the model on natural images.
- DocVQA (Mathew et al., 2020) is a benchmark dataset focused on document analysis and recognition. It contains images of a wide range of documents which evaluates a model's ability to perform OCR understanding and reason about the contents of a document to answer questions about them.

Table 29 presents the results of our experiments. The results in the table show that our vision module attached to Llama 3 performs competitively across a wide range of image-recognition benchmarks at varying model capacities. Using the resulting Llama 3-V 405B model, we outperform GPT-4V on all benchmarks, while being slightly behind Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Llama 3 405B appears particularly competitive on document understanding tasks.

### 7.7 Video Recognition Results

We evaluate our video adapter for Llama 3 on three benchmarks:

- PerceptionTest (Pătrăucean et al., 2023) evaluates the model's ability to answer temporal reasoning questions focusing on skills (memory, abstraction, physics, semantics) and different types of reasoning (descriptive, explanatory, predictive, counterfactual). It consists of 11.6K test QA pairs, each with an on-average 23s long video, filmed by 100 participants worldwide to show perceptually interesting tasks. We focus on the multiple-choice question answering task, where each question is paired with

three possible options. We report performance on the held-out test split which is accessed by submitting our predictions to an online challenge server.16

- NExT-QA (Xiao et al., 2021) is another temporal and causal reasoning benchmark, with a focus on open-ended question answering. It consists of 1K test videos each on-average 44s in length, paired with 9K questions. The evaluation is performed by comparing the model's responses with the ground truth answer using Wu-Palmer Similarity (WUPS) (Wu and Palmer, 1994).17
- TVQA (Lei et al., 2018) evaluates the model's ability to perform compositional reasoning, requiring spatiotemporal localization of relevant moments, recognition of visual concepts, and joint reasoning with subtitle-based dialogue. This dataset, being derived from popular TV shows, additionally tests for the model's ability to leverage its outside-knowledge of those TV shows in answering the questions. It consists of over 15K validation QA pairs, with each corresponding video clip being on-average 76s in length. It also follows a multiple-choice format with five options for each question, and we report performance on the validation set following prior work (OpenAI, 2023b).
- ActivityNet-QA (Yu et al., 2019) evaluates the model's ability to reason over long video clips to understand actions, spatial relations, temporal relations, counting, etc. It consists of 8K test QA pairs from 800 videos, each on-average 3 minutes long. For evaluation, we follow the protocol from prior work (Google, 2023; Lin et al., 2023; Maaz et al., 2024), where the model generates short one-word or one-phrase answers, and the correctness of the output is evaluated using the GPT-3.5 API which compares it to the ground truth answer. We report the average accuracy as evaluated by the API.

When performing inference, we uniformly sample frames from the full video clip and pass those frames into the model with a short text prompt. Since most of our benchmarks involve answering multiple-choice questions, we use the following prompt: Select the correct answer from the following options: {question}. Answer with the correct option letter and nothing else. For benchmarks that require producing a short answer (e.g., ActivityNet-QA and NExT-QA), we use the following prompt: Answer the question using a single word or phrase. {question}. For NExT-QA, since the evaluation metric (WUPS) is sensitive to the length and the specific words used, we additionally prompt the model to be specific and respond with the most salient answer, for instance specifying "living room" instead of simply responding with "house" when asked a location question. For benchmarks that contain subtitles (i.e., TVQA), we include the subtitles corresponding to the clip in the prompt during inference.

We present the performance of Llama 3 8B and 70B in Table 30. We compare Llama 3's performance with that of two Gemini and two GPT-4 models. Note that all our results are zero-shot, as we do not include any part of these benchmarks in our training or finetuning data. We find that our Llama 3 models that train a small video adapter during post-training are very competitive, and in some cases even better, than other models that potentially leverage native multimodal processing all the way from pre-training. Llama 3 performs particularly well on video recognition given that we only evaluate the 8B and 70B parameter models. Llama 3 achieves its best performance on PerceptionTest, suggesting the model has a strong ability to perform complex temporal reasoning. On long-form activity understanding tasks like ActivityNet-QA, Llama 3 is able to obtain strong results even though it is processing only up to 64 frames, which means that for a 3-minute long video the model only processes one frame every 3 seconds.

### 8 Speech Experiments

We perform experiments to study a compositional approach of integrating speech capabilities into Llama 3, resembling the method we used for visual recognition. On the input side, an encoder, together with an adapter, is incorporated to process speech signals. We leverage a system prompt (in text) to enable different modes of operation for speech understanding in Llama 3. If no system prompt is provided, the model acts as a general-purpose spoken dialogue model which can effectively respond to the user speech in a manner that is consistent with the text-only version of Llama 3. The dialogue history is introduced as the prompt prefix to improve the multi-round dialogue experience. We also experiment with system prompts that enable the use of Llama 3 for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and automatic speech translation (AST). The speech interface of Llama 3 supports up to 34 languages.18 It also allows for the interleaved input of text and speech, enabling the model to solve advanced audio-comprehension tasks.

We also experiment with a speech generation approach in which we implement a streaming text-to-speech (TTS) system that generates speech waveforms on-the-fly during language model decoding. We design the speech generator for Llama 3 based on a proprietary TTS system and do not fine-tune the language model for speech generation. Instead, we focus on improving speech synthesis latency, accuracy, and naturalness by leveraging Llama 3 embeddings at inference time. The speech interface is illustrated in Figure 28 and 29.

#### 8.1 Data

#### 8.1.1 Speech Understanding

The training data can be categorized into two types. The pre-training data includes a large amount of unlabeled speech, which is used to initialize the speech encoder in a self-supervised manner. The supervised finetuning data includes speech recognition, speech translation, and spoken dialogue data; this data is used to unlock specific abilities when integrated with the large language model.

Pre-training data. To pre-train the speech encoder, we curate a dataset of approximately 15M hours of speech recordings encompassing a large number of languages. We filter our audio data using a voice activity detection (VAD) model and select audio samples with a VAD threshold above 0.7 for pre-training. In speech pre-training data, we also focus on ensuring the absence of PII. We use the Presidio Analyzer to identify such PII.

Speech recognition and translation data. Our ASR training data contains 230K hours of manually transcribed speech recordings that span 34 languages. Our AST training data contains 90K hours of translations in two directions: from 33 languages to English and from English to 33 languages. This data contains both supervised and synthetic data generated using the NLLB toolkit (NLLB Team et al., 2022). The use of synthetic AST data enables us to increase model quality for low-resource languages. The speech segments in our data have a maximum length of 60 seconds.

Spoken dialogue data. To finetune the speech adapter for spoken dialogue, we synthetically generate responses

<sup>18</sup>The speech interface supports the following 34 languages: Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Malayalam, Marathi, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Urdu, Vietnamese.

for speech prompts by asking the language model to respond to transcriptions of those prompts (Fathullah et al., 2024). We generate synthetic data this way using a subset of the ASR dataset with 60K hours of speech. In addition, we generate 25K hours of synthetic data by running the Voicebox TTS system (Le et al., 2024) on subsets of the data used to finetune Llama 3. We used several heuristics to select a subset of finetuning data that matches the distribution of speech. These heuristics include focusing on relatively short prompts with a simple structure and without non-text symbols.

#### 8.1.2 Speech Generation

The speech generation datasets mainly consist of those for training the text normalization (TN) model and the prosody model (PM). Both training data are augmented with an additional input feature of the Llama 3 embeddings to provide contextual information.

Text normalization data. Our TN training dataset includes 55K samples that cover a wide range of semiotic classes (e.g., number, date, time) that require non-trivial normalization. Each sample is a pair of written-form text and the corresponding normalized spoken-form text, with an inferred sequence of handcrafted TN rules that carry out the normalization.

Prosody model data. The PM training data includes linguistic and prosodic features extracted from a 50K-hour TTS dataset, which are paired transcripts and audios recorded by professional voice actors in studio settings.

Llama 3 embedding. The Llama 3 embeddings are taken as the output of the 16th decoder layer. We work exclusively with the Llama 3 8B model and extract the embeddings for a given text (i.e. written-form input text for TN or the audio transcript for PM) as if they are generated by the Llama 3 model with an empty user prompt. In a given sample, each chunk in the Llama 3 token sequence is explicitly aligned with the corresponding chunks in native input sequence for TN or PM, i.e., TN-specific text tokens (demarcated by unicode category) or phone-rate features respectively. This allows for training the TN and PM modules with streaming input of Llama 3 tokens and embeddings.

### 8.2 Model Architecture

### 8.2.1 Speech Understanding

On the input side, the speech module consists of two successive modules: a speech encoder and an adapter. The output of the speech module is directly fed into the language model as token representation, enabling direct interaction between speech and text tokens. Furthermore, we incorporate two new special tokens to enclose the sequence of speech representations. The speech module differs substantially from the vision module (see Section 7), which feeds multi-modal information into the language model via cross-attention layers. By contrast, the speech module generates embeddings that can be seamlessly integrated with text tokens, enabling the speech interface to leverage all the capabilities of the Llama 3 language model.

Speech encoder. Our speech encoder is a Conformer (Gulati et al., 2020) model with 1B parameters. The input to the model consists of 80-dimensional mel-spectrogram features, which are first processed by a stride-4 stacking layer followed by a linear projection to reduce the frame length to 40 ms. The resulting features are processed by an encoder with 24 Conformer layers. Each Conformer layer has a latent dimension of 1536, and consists of two Macron-net style feed-forward networks with dimension 4096, a convolution module with kernel size 7, and a rotary attention module (Su et al., 2024) with 24 attention heads.

Speech adapter. The speech adapter contains about 100M parameters. It is composed of a convolution layer, a rotary Transformer layer, and a linear layer. The convolution layer has a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 2, which is designed to reduce the speech frame length to 80ms. This allows the model to provide more coarse-grained features to the language model. The Transformer layer has a latent dimension of 3072 and a feed-forward network with a dimension of 4096 which further processes the information from speech with context after the convolutional downsampling. Finally, the linear layer maps the output dimension to match that of the language-model embedding layer.

#### 8.2.2 Speech Generation

We use Llama 3 8B embeddings in two key components for speech generation: Text Normalization and Prosody Modeling. The TN module ensures semantic correctness by contextually transforming written text into spoken form. The PM module enhances naturalness and expressiveness by predicting prosodic features using these embeddings. Together, they enable accurate and natural speech generation.

Text normalization. As a determinant of the semantic correctness of generated speech, the text normalization (TN) module carries out context-aware transformation from written-form text into the respective spoken form which is eventually verbalized by the downstream components. For example, the written-form text 123 is read as a cardinal number (one hundred twenty three) or spelled digit-by-digit (one two three) depending on the semantic context. The TN system consists of a streaming LSTM-based sequence-tagging model that predicts the sequence of handcrafted TN rules used to transform the input text (Kang et al., 2024). The neural model also takes in Llama 3 embeddings via cross attention to leverage the contextual information encoded therein, enabling minimal text token lookahead and streaming input/output.

Prosody modeling. To enhance the naturalness and expressiveness of synthesized speech, we integrate a decoder-only Transformer-based Prosody model (PM) (Radford et al., 2021) that takes the Llama 3 embeddings as an additional input. This integration leverages the linguistic capabilities of Llama 3, utilizing both its textual output and intermediate embeddings at the token rate (Devlin et al., 2018; Dong et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2023) to enhance the prediction of prosody features, thus reducing the lookahead required by the model.

The PM integrates several input components to generate comprehensive prosody predictions: linguistic features derived from the text normalization front-end detailed above, tokens, and embeddings. The PM predicts three key prosodic features: log duration of each phone, log F0 (fundamental frequency) average, and log power average across the phone duration. The model comprises a uni-directional Transformer and six attention heads. Each block includes cross-attention layers and dual fully connected layers with a hidden dimension of 864. A distinctive feature of the PM is its dual cross-attention mechanism, with one layer dedicated to linguistic inputs and the other to Llama embeddings. This setup efficiently manages varying input rates without requiring explicit alignment.

### 8.3 Training Recipe

### 8.3.1 Speech Understanding

Training of the speech module is done in two stages. The first stage, speech pre-training, leverages unlabeled data to train a speech encoder that exhibits strong generalization capabilities across languages and acoustic conditions. In the second stage, supervised fine-tuning, the adapter and pre-trained encoder are integrated with the language model, and trained jointly with it while the LLM stays frozen. This enables the model to respond to speech input. This stage uses labeled data corresponding to speech understanding abilities.

Multilingual ASR and AST modeling often results in language confusion/interference, which leads to degraded performance. A popular way to mitigate this is to incorporate language identification (LID) information, both on the source and target side. This can lead to improved performance in the predetermined set of directions, but it does come with potential loss of generality. For instance, if a translation system expects LID on both source and target side, then the model will not likely to show good zero-shot performance in directions that were not seen in training. So our challenge is to design a system that allows LID information to some extent, but keeps the model general enough such that we can have the model do speech translation in unseen directions. To address this, we design system prompts which only contain LID for the text to be emitted (target side). There is no LID information for the speech input (source side) in these prompts, which also potentially allows it to work with code-switched speech. For ASR, we use the following system prompt: Repeat after me in {language}:, where {language} comes from one of the 34 languages (English, French, etc.) For speech translation, the system prompt is: Translate the following sentence into {language}:. This design has been shown to be effective in prompting the language model to respond in the desired language. We used the same system prompts during training and inference.

Speech pre-training. We use the self-supervised BEST-RQ algorithm (Chiu et al., 2022) to pre-train the speech

encoder. We apply a mask of 32-frame length with a probability of 2.5% to the input mel-spectrogram. If the speech utterances are longer than 60 seconds, we perform a random crop of 6K frames, corresponding to 60 seconds of speech. We quantize mel-spectrogram features by stacking 4 consecutive frames, projecting the 320-dimensional vectors to a 16-dimensional space, and performing a nearest-neighbor search with respect to cosine similarity metric within a codebook of 8,192 vectors. To stabilize pre-training, we employ 16 different codebooks. The projection matrix and codebooks are randomly initialized and are not updated throughout the model training. The multi-softmax loss is used only on masked frames for efficiency reasons. The encoder is trained for 500K steps with a global batch size of 2,048 utterances.

Supervised finetuning. Both the pre-trained speech encoder and the randomly initialized adapter are further jointly optimized with Llama 3 in the supervised finetuning stage. The language model remains unchanged during this process. The training data is a mixture of ASR, AST, and spoken dialogue data. The speech model for Llama 3 8B is trained for 650K updates, using a global batch size of 512 utterances and an initial learning rate of 10−4 . The speech model for Llama 3 70B is trained for 600K updates, using a global batch size of 768 utterances and an initial learning rate of 4 × 10−5 .

#### 8.3.2 Speech Generation

To support real-time processing, the prosody model employs a lookahead mechanism that considers a fixed number of future phones and a variable number of future tokens. This ensures consistent lookahead while processing incoming text, which is crucial for low-latency speech synthesis applications.

Training. We develop a dynamic alignment strategy utilizing causal masking to facilitate streamability in speech synthesis. This strategy incorporates a lookahead mechanism for a fixed number of future phones and a variable number of future tokens, aligning with the chunking process during text normalization (Section 8.1.2). For each phone, the token lookahead includes the maximum number of tokens defined by the chunk size, resulting in variable lookahead for Llama embeddings but fixed lookahead for phonemes.

The Llama 3 embeddings are sourced from the Llama 3 8B model, which remains frozen during the training of the Prosody Model. The input phone-rate features include both linguistic and speaker/style controllability elements. The model training is conducted with a batch size of 1,024 utterances, each with a maximum length of 500 phones. We employ a learning rate of 9 × 10−4 using the AdamW optimizer, training over 1 million updates with a learning rate warmup for the first 3,000 updates, following a cosine schedule.

Inference. During inference, the same lookahead mechanism and causal masking strategy are employed to ensure consistency between training and real-time processing. The PM handles incoming text in a streaming manner, updating the input phone by phone for phone-rate features and chunk by chunk for token-rate features. The new chunk input is updated only when the first phone for that chunk is current, maintaining the alignment and lookahead as during training.

For prosody target prediction, we employ a delayed pattern approach (Kharitonov et al., 2021), which enhances the model's ability to capture and reproduce long-range prosodic dependencies. This approach contributes to the naturalness and expressiveness of the synthesized speech, ensuring low-latency and high-quality output.

### 8.4 Speech Understanding Results

We evaluate the speech understanding capabilities of our speech interface for Llama 3 on three tasks: (1) automatic speech recognition, (2) speech translation, and (3) spoken question answering. We compare the performance of our speech interface for Llama 3 with three state-of-the-art models for speech understanding: Whisper (Radford et al., 2023), SeamlessM4T (Barrault et al., 2023), and Gemini.19 In all the evaluations, we used greedy search for Llama 3 token prediction.

Speech recognition. We evaluate the ASR performance on the English datasets of Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS; Pratap et al. (2020)), LibriSpeech (Panayotov et al., 2015), VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021a), and a subset of the multilingual FLEURS dataset (Conneau et al., 2023). In evaluation, the decoding results are post-processed using the Whisper text normalizer to ensure consistency in comparing with the reported results of other models. On all benchmarks, we measure the word error rate of our speech interface for Llama 3

<sup>19</sup>Due to technical limitations, we compare with the performance of Gemini on MLS reported in the original paper.

Table 31 shows the results of ASR evaluations. It demonstrates the strong performance of Llama 3 (and multi-modal foundation models more generally) on speech recognition tasks: our model outperforms models that are tailored to speech like Whisper20 and SeamlessM4T on all benchmarks. On MLS English, Llama 3 performs similarly to Gemini.

Speech translation. We also evaluate our models on speech translation tasks in which the model is asked to translate non-English speech into English text. We use the FLEURS and Covost 2 (Wang et al., 2021b) datasets in these evaluations, measuring BLEU scores of the translated English. Table 32 presents the results of these experiments.21 The performance of our models in speech translation highlights the advantages of multimodal foundation models for tasks such as speech translation.

Spoken question answering. The speech interface of Llama 3 demonstrates remarkable question answering capabilities. The model can effortlessly comprehend code-switched speech without any prior exposure to such data. Notably, although the model was trained only on single-turn dialogue, it is capable of engaging in extended, coherent multi-turn dialogue sessions. Figure 30 presents a few examples that highlight these multilingual and multi-turn capabilities.

Safety. We evaluate the safety of our speech model on MuTox (Costa-jussà et al., 2023), a multilingual audio-based dataset of 20,000 utterances for English and Spanish and 4,000 for 19 other languages, each with toxicity labels attached. The audio is passed as input to the model and the output is evaluated for toxicity, after cleaning some special characters. We apply the MuTox classifier (Costa-jussà et al., 2023) and compare the results with Gemini 1.5 Pro. We evaluate the percentage of added toxicity (AT), when the input prompt is safe and the output is toxic, and the percentage of lost toxicity (LT), when the input prompt is toxic and the answer is safe. Table 33 shows the results for English and an average across all 21 languages that we evaluated on.22 The percentage of added toxicity is very low: our speech models have the lowest percentage of added toxicity for English, with less than 1%. It removes significantly more toxicity than it adds.

### 8.5 Speech Generation Results

For speech generation, we focus on evaluating the quality of token-wise input streaming models with the Llama 3 embeddings for the text normalization and prosody modeling tasks. The evaluation focuses on

<sup>20</sup>On FLEURS ASR, Malayalam is not officially reported for Whisper v3, so we use the average of 33 languages.

<sup>21</sup>On Covost 2, we evaluate only on 15 (out of 21) languages.

<sup>22</sup>Note that for Gemini, we encountered that a significant number of responses were empty, which could be due to safety filters on their side (though some empty responses were for non-toxic input) or to rate limits. To conduct the analysis, we assumed that all the empty responses are safe. This is the most conservative approach for results and the upper bound of what Gemini results would look like.

comparisons with models that do not take the Llama 3 embeddings as an additional input.

Text normalization. To measure the effect of Llama 3 embeddings, we experimented with changing the amount of right context the model uses. We trained the model using a right context of 3 TN tokens (demarcated by unicode category). This model is compared to models that do not use the Llama 3 embeddings, using a 3-token right context or a full bi-directional context. As expected, Table 34 shows using the full right context improves performance for the model without Llama 3 embeddings. However, the model that incorporates the Llama 3 embeddings outperforms all other models, hence enabling token-rate input/output streaming without relying on long context in the input.

Prosody modeling. To evaluate the performance of the our prosody model (PM) with Llama 3 8B, we conducted two sets of human evaluation comparing models with and without Llama 3 embeddings. Raters listened to samples from different models and indicated their preferences. To generate the final speech waveform, we use an inhouse transformer based acoustic model (Wu et al., 2021) that predicts spectral features and a WaveRNN neural vocoder (Kalchbrenner et al., 2018) to generate the final speech waveform.

| Model | Context | Accuracy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Without Llama 3 8B | 3 | 73.6% |
| Without Llama 3 8B | ∞ | 88.0% |
| With Llama 3 8B | 3 | 90.7% |

Table 34 Sample-wise text normalization (TN) accuracy. We compare models with or without Llama 3 8B embeddings, and using different right-context values.

First, we compare directly to a streaming baseline model without Llama 3 embeddings. In the second test, the Llama 3 8B PM is compared to a non-streaming baseline model without Llama 3 embeddings. As shown in Table 35, the Llama 3 8B PM is preferred 60% of the time compared to the streaming baseline, and

| Model | Preference | Model | Preference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PM for Llama 3 8B | 60.0% | PM for Llama 3 8B | 63.6% |
| Streaming phone-only baseline | 40.0% | Non-streaming phone-only baseline | 36.4% |

Table 35 Prosody Modeling (PM) evaluation. Left: Rater preferences of PM for Llama 3 8B vs. streaming phone-only baseline. Right: Rater preferences of PM for Llama 3 8B vs. non-streaming phone-only baseline.

63.6% of the time compared to the non-streaming baseline, indicating a significant improvement in perceived quality. The key advantage of the Llama 3 8B PM is its token-wise streaming capability (Section 8.2.2), which maintains low latency during inference. This reduces the model's lookahead requirements, enabling more responsive and real-time speech synthesis compared to non-streaming baselines. Overall, the Llama 3 8B prosody model consistently outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the naturalness and expressiveness of synthesized speech.

### 9 Related Work

The development of Llama 3 builds on a large body of prior work studying foundation models for language, images, videos, and speech. A comprehensive overview of that work is outside the scope of this paper; we refer the reader to Bordes et al. (2024); Madan et al. (2024); Zhao et al. (2023a) for such overviews. Below, we briefly outline seminal works that directly influenced the development of Llama 3.

#### 9.1 Language

Scale. Llama 3 follows the enduring trend of applying straightforward methods at ever increasing scales in foundation models. Improvements are driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model using almost fifty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing 405B parameters, our largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as PALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022). Little is publicly known about the size of other frontier models, such as Claude 3 or GPT 4 (OpenAI, 2023a), but overall performance is compareable.

Small models. Developments in smaller models have paralleled those in large models. Models with fewer parameters can dramatically improve inference cost and simplify deployment (Mehta et al., 2024; Team et al., 2024). The smaller Llama 3 models achieve this by training far beyond the point of compute optimal training, effectively trading training compute for inference efficiency. An alternative path is to distill larger models into smaller ones, as in Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).

Architectures. While Llama 3 makes minimal architectural modifiations to compared to Llama 2, other recent foundation models have explored other designs. Most notably, mixture of experts architectures (Shazeer et al., 2017; Lewis et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) can be used as an efficient way to increase the capacity of a models, such as in Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024) and Arctic (Snowflake, 2024). Llama 3 outperforms these models, suggesting that dense architectures are not the limiting factor, but there remain numerous trade offs in terms of training and inference efficiency, and model stability at scale.

Open source. Open weights foundation models have rapidly improved over the last year, with Llama3-405B now competitive with the current closed weight state-of-the-art. Numerous model families have recently been developed, including Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023), MPT (Databricks, 2024), Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023), Arctic (Snowflake, 2024), OpenELM (Mehta et al., 2024), OLMo (Groeneveld et al., 2024), StableLM (Bellagente et al., 2024), OpenLLaMA (Geng and Liu, 2023), Qwen (Bai et al., 2023), Gemma (Team et al., 2024), Grok (XAI, 2024), and Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).

Post-training. Post-training Llama 3 follows the established strategy of instruction tuning (Chung et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022) followed by alignment with human feedback (Kaufmann et al., 2023). While some studies have shown the surprising effectiveness of lightweight alignment procedures (Zhou et al., 2024), Llama 3 uses millions of human instructions and preference judgments to improve the pre-trained model, including

techniques such as rejection sampling (Bai et al., 2022), supervised finetuning (Sanh et al., 2022), and Direct Preference Optimization (Rafailov et al., 2023). In order to curate these instruction and preference examples, we deploy earlier versions of Llama 3 to filter (Liu et al., 2024c), re-write (Pan et al., 2024), or generate prompts and responses (Liu et al., 2024b) and apply these techniques through multiple rounds of post-training.

### 9.2 Multimodality

Our experiments with multimodal capabilities for Llama 3 are part of a long line of work on foundation models that jointly model multiple modalities.

Images. A substantial body of work has trained image-recognition models on large amounts of image-text pairs, for example, Mahajan et al. (2018); Xiao et al. (2024a); Team (2024); OpenAI (2023b). Radford et al. (2021) presented one of the first models to jointly embed images and text via contrastive learning. More recently, a series of models has studied approaches similar to the one used in Llama 3, for example, Alayrac et al. (2022); Dai et al. (2023); Liu et al. (2023c,b); Yang et al. (2023b); Ye et al. (2023); Zhu et al. (2023). Our approach in Llama 3 combines ideas from many of these papers to achieve results that are comparable with Gemini 1.0 Ultra (Google, 2023) and GPT-4 Vision (OpenAI, 2023b); see Section 7.6.

Video. Although video inputs are supported by an increasing number of foundation models (Google, 2023; OpenAI, 2023b), the body of work on joint modeling of videos and language is not that large. Akin to Llama 3, most current studies adopt an adapter approach to align video and language representations and unlock question-answering and reasoning about videos (Lin et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a; Maaz et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2022). We find that such approaches produce results that are competitive with the state-of-the-art; see Section 7.7.

Speech. Our work also fits in a larger body of work combining language and speech modeling. Earlier joint models of text and speech include AudioPaLM (Rubenstein et al., 2023), VioLA (Wang et al., 2023b), VoxtLM Maiti et al. (2023), SUTLM (Chou et al., 2023), and Spirit-LM (Nguyen et al., 2024). Our work builds on prior compositional approaches to combining speech and language like Fathullah et al. (2024). Unlike most prior work, we opt to not finetune the language model itself for speech tasks as doing so may lead to contention on non-speech tasks. We find that at larger model scales, strong performances are attainable even without such finetuning; see Section 8.4.

## 10 Conclusion

In many ways, the development of high-quality foundation models is still in its infancy. Our experience in developing Llama 3 suggests that substantial further improvements of these models are on the horizon. Throughout the development of the Llama 3 model family, we found that a strong focus on high-quality data, scale, and simplicity consistently yielded the best results. In preliminary experiments, we explored more complex model architectures and training recipes but did not find the benefits of such approaches to outweigh the additional complexity they introduce in model development.

Developing a flagship foundation model such as Llama 3 involves overcoming a plethora of deep technical problems but also requires clever organizational decisions. For example, to ensure Llama 3 is not accidentally overfitted on commonly used benchmarks, our pre-training data was procured and processed by a separate team that was strongly incentivized to prevent contamination of that pre-training data with external benchmarks. As another example, we ensure that our human evaluations remain trustworthy by allowing only a small set of researchers who do not contribute to model development to perform and access these evaluations. While such organizational decisions are rarely discussed in technical papers, we found them to be pivotal to the successful development of the Llama 3 family of models.

We shared the details of our development process because we believe this will: (1) help the larger research community understand the key factors of foundation model development and (2) contribute to a more informed debate about the future of foundation models in the general public. We also shared preliminary experiments with integrating multimodal capabilities into Llama 3. While these models are still under active development and not yet ready for release, we hope sharing our results early will accelerate research in this direction.

Following the positive outcomes of the detailed safety analyses presented in this paper, we publicly release our Llama 3 language models in order to accelerate the development of AI systems for a plethora of societally relevant use cases and enable the research community to scrutinize our models and identify ways to make these models better and safer. We believe that the public release of foundation models plays a key role in the responsible development of such models, and we hope that the release of Llama 3 encourages the industry to embrace the open, responsible development of AGI.

## Abstract

*Efficient neural network backbones for mobile devices are often optimized for metrics such as FLOPs or parameter count. However, these metrics may not correlate well with latency of the network when deployed on a mobile device. Therefore, we perform extensive analysis of different metrics by deploying several mobile-friendly networks on a mobile device. We identify and analyze architectural and optimization bottlenecks in recent efficient neural networks and provide ways to mitigate these bottlenecks. To this end, we design an efficient backbone MobileOne, with variants achieving an inference time under 1 ms on an iPhone12 with 75.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. We show that MobileOne achieves state-of-the-art performance within the efficient architectures while being many times faster on mobile. Our best model obtains similar performance on ImageNet as MobileFormer while being 38*× *faster. Our model obtains 2.3% better top-1 accuracy on ImageNet than EfficientNet at similar latency. Furthermore, we show that our model generalizes to multiple tasks – image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation with significant improvements in latency and accuracy as compared to existing efficient architectures when deployed on a mobile device. Code and models are available at* https: //github.com/apple/ml-mobileone

### 1. Introduction

Design and deployment of efficient deep learning architectures for mobile devices has seen a lot of progress [5, 30,31,43,45,47] with consistently decreasing floating-point operations (FLOPs) and parameter count while improving accuracy. However, these metrics may not correlate well with the efficiency [9] of the models in terms of latency. Efficiency metric like FLOPs do not account for memory access cost and degree of parallelism, which can have a nontrivial effect on latency during inference [43]. Parameter count is also not well correlated with latency. For example, sharing parameters leads to higher FLOPS but smaller model size. Furthermore, parameter-less operations like skip-connections [24] or branching [33,50] can incur significant memory access costs. This disconnect can get exacerbated when custom accelerators are available in the regime of efficient architectures.

Our goal is to improve the latency cost of efficient architectures while improving their accuracy by identifying key architectural and optimization bottlenecks that affect ondevice latency. To identify architectural bottlenecks, we deploy neural networks on an iPhone12 by using CoreML [57] and benchmark their latency costs. To alleviate optimization bottlenecks, we decouple train-time and inferencetime architectures, i.e. using a linearly over-parameterized model at train-time and re-parameterizing the linear structures at inference [11–13]. We further alleviate optimization bottleneck by dynamically relaxing regularization throughout training to prevent the already small models from being over-regularized.

Based on our findings on the key bottlenecks, we design a novel architecture *MobileOne*, variants of which run under 1 ms on an iPhone12 achieving state-of-the-art accuracy within efficient architecture family while being significantly faster on the device. Like prior works on structural re-parameterization [11–13], MobileOne introduces linear branches at train-time which get re-parameterized at inference. However, a key difference between our model and prior structural re-parameterization works is the introduction of trivial over-parameterization branches, which provides further improvements in low parameter regime and model scaling strategy. At inference, our model has simple feed-forward structure without any branches or skipconnections. Since this structure incurs lower memory access cost, we can incorporate wider layers in our network which boosts representation capacity as demonstrated empirically in Table 9. For example, MobileOne-S1 has 4.8M parameters and incurs a latency of 0.89ms, while MobileNet-V2 [47] has 3.4M (29.2% less than MobileOne-S1) parameters and incurs a latency of 0.98ms. At this operating point, MobileOne attains 3.9% better top-1 accuracy than MobileNet-V2.

Figure 1. We show comparisons of Top-1 accuracy on image classification vs latency on an iPhone 12 (a), and zoomed out area (b) to include recent transformer architectures. We show mAP on object detection vs Top-1 accuracy on image classification in (c) with size of the marker indicating latency of the backbone on iPhone 12. Our models have significantly smaller latency compared to related works. Please refer to supp. mat. for higher resolution figures.

MobileOne achieves significant improvements in latency compared to efficient models in literature while maintaining the accuracy on several tasks – image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. As shown in Figure 6, MobileOne performs better than MobileViT-S [45] while being 5 × faster on image classification. As compared to EfficientNet-B0 [54], we achieve 2.3% better top-1 accuracy on ImageNet [10] with similar latency costs (see Figure 5). Furthermore, as seen in Figure 7, MobileOne models not only perform well on ImageNet, they also generalize to other tasks like object detection. Models like MobileNetV3- L [30] and MixNet-S [55] improve over MobileNetV2 on ImageNet, but those improvements do not translate to object detection task. As shown in Figure 7, MobileOne shows better generalization across tasks. For object detection on MS-COCO [37], best variant of MobileOne outperforms best variant MobileViT by 6.1% and MNASNet by 27.8%. For semantic segmentation, on PascalVOC [16] dataset, best variant of MobileOne outperforms best variant MobileViT by 1.3% and on ADE20K [65] dataset, best variant of MobileOne outperforms MobileNetV2 by 12.0%. In summary, our contributions are as follows:

- We introduce *MobileOne*, a novel architecture that
runs within 1 ms on a mobile device and achieves stateof-the-art accuracy on image classification within efficient model architectures. The performance of our model also generalizes to a desktop CPU and GPU.

- We analyze performance bottlenecks in activations and branching that incur high latency costs on mobile in recent efficient networks.
- We analyze the effects of train-time re-parameterizable branches and dynamic relaxation of regularization in training. In combination, they help alleviating optimization bottlenecks encountered when training small models.
- We show that our model generalizes well to other tasks – object detection and semantic segmentation while outperforming recent state-of-the-art efficient models.

We will release our trained networks and code for research purposes. We will also release the code for iOS application to enable benchmarking of networks on iPhone.

### 2. Related Work

Designing a real-time efficient neural network involves a trade-off between accuracy and performance. Earlier methods like SqueezeNet [34] and more recently Mobile-ViT [45], optimize for parameter count and a vast majority of methods like MobileNets [31, 47], MobileNeXt [66], ShuffleNet-V1 [64], GhostNet [20], MixNet [55] focus on optimizing for the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). EfficientNet [54] and TinyNet [21] study the compound scaling of depth, width and resolution while optimizing FLOPs. Few methods like MNASNet [53], MobileNetV3 [30] and ShuffleNet-V2 [43] optimize directly for latency. Dehghani et al. [9] show that FLOPs and parameter count are not well correlated with latency. Therefore, our work focuses on improving on-device latency while improving the accuracy.

Recently, ViT [14] and ViT-like architectures [58] have shown state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet dataset. Different designs like ViT-C [62], CvT [61], BoTNet [49], ConViT [8] and PiT [29] have been explored to incorporate biases using convolutions in ViT. More recently, MobileFormer [5] and MobileViT [45] were introduced to get ViT-like performance on a mobile platform. MobileViT optimizes for parameter count and MobileFormer optimizes for FLOPs and outperforms efficient CNNs in low FLOP regime. However, as we show in subsequent sections that low FLOPs does not necessarily result in low latency. We study key design choices made by these methods and their impact on latency.

Recent methods also introduce new architecture designs and custom layers to improve accuracy for mobile backbones. MobileNet-V3 [30], introduces an optimized activation function – Hard-Swish for a specific platform. However, scaling such functions to different platforms may be difficult.

Therefore, our design uses basic operators that are already available across different platforms. Expand-Nets [19], ACNet [11] and DBBNet [12], propose a dropin replacement for a regular convolution layer in recent CNN architectures and show improvements in accuracy. RepVGG [13] introduces re-parameterizable skip connections which is beneficial to train VGG-like model to better performance. These architectures have linear branches at train-time that get re-parameterized to simpler blocks at inference. We build on these re-parametrization works and introduce trivial over-parameterization branches thereby providing further improvements in accuracy.

### 3. Method

In this section, we analyse the correlation of popular metrics – FLOPs and parameter count – with latency on a mobile device. We also evaluate how different design

|  |  | FLOPs |  | Parameters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Type | corr. | p-value | corr. | p-value |
| Mobile Latency | 0.47 | 0.03 | 0.30 | 0.18 |
| CPU Latency | 0.06 | 0.80 | 0.07 | 0.77 |

Table 1. Spearman rank correlation coeff. between latency-flops.

choices in architectures effect the latency on the phone. Based on the evaluation, we describe our architecture and training algorithm.

#### 3.1. Metric Correlations

The most commonly used cost indicators for comparing the size of two or more models are parameter count and FLOPs [9]. However, they may not be well correlated with latency in real-world mobile applications. Therefore, we study the correlation of latency with FLOPS and parameter count for benchmarking efficient neural networks. We consider recent models and use their Pytorch implementation to convert them into ONNX format [2]. We convert each of these models to coreml packages using Core ML Tools [57]. We then develop an iOS application to measure the latency of the models on an iPhone12.

We plot latency vs. FLOPs and latency vs. parameter count as shown in Figure 2. We observe that many models with higher parameter count can have lower latency. We observe a similar plot between FLOPs and latency. Furthermore, we note the convolutional models such as MobileNets [43, 47, 56] have lower latency for similar FLOPs and parameter count than their transformer counterparts [5,45,58]. We also estimate the Spearman rank correlation [63] in Table 1a. We find that latency is moderately correlated with FLOPs and weakly correlated with parameter counts for efficient architectures on a mobile device. This correlation is even lower on a desktop CPU.

### 3.2. Key Bottlenecks

Activation Functions To analyze the effect of activation functions on latency, we construct a 30 layer convolutional neural network and benchmark it on iPhone12 using different activation functions, commonly used in efficient CNN backbones. All models in Table 2 have the same architecture except for activations, but their latencies are drastically different. This can be attributed to synchronization costs mostly incurred by recently introduced activation functions like SE-ReLU [32], Dynamic Shift-Max [36] and DynamicReLUs [6]. DynamicReLU and Dynamic Shift-Max have shown significant accuracy improvement in extremely low FLOP models like MicroNet [36], but, the latency cost of using these activations can be significant. Therefore we use only ReLU activations in MobileOne.

| SE-ReLU [32] | 2.10 |
| SiLU [15] | 2.54 |
| Dynamic Shift-Max [36] | 57.04 |
| DynamicReLU-A [6] | 273.49 |
| DynamicReLU-B [6] | 242.14 |

Architectural Blocks Two of the key factors that affect runtime performance are memory access cost and degree of parallelism [43]. Memory access cost increases significantly in multi-branch architectures as activations from each branch have to be stored to compute the next tensor in the graph. Such memory bottlenecks can be avoided if the network has smaller number of branches. Architectural

| Architectural |  | + Squeeze | + Skip |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Blocks | Baseline | Excite [32] | Connections [23] |
| Latency (ms) | 1.53 | 2.10 | 2.62 |

Table 3. Ablation on latency of different architectural blocks in a 30-layer convolutional neural network.

blocks that force synchronization like global pooling operations used in Squeeze-Excite block [32] also affect overall run-time due to synchronization costs. To demonstrate the hidden costs like memory access cost and synchronization cost, we ablate over using skip connections and squeezeexcite blocks in a 30 layer convolutional neural network. In Table 3b, we show how each of these choices contribute towards latency. Therefore we adopt an architecture with no branches at inference, which results in smaller memory access cost. In addition, we limit the use of Squeeze-Excite blocks to our biggest variant in order to improve accuracy.

#### 3.3. MobileOne Architecture

Based on the our evaluations of different design choices, we develop the architecture of MobileOne. Like prior works on structural re-parameterization [11–13,19], the train-time and inference time architecture of MobileOne is different. In this section, we introduce the basic block of MobileOne and the model scaling strategy used to build the network.

MobileOne Block MobileOne blocks are similar to blocks introduced in [11–13, 19], except that our blocks are designed for convolutional layers that are factorized into depthwise and pointwise layers. Furthermore, we introduce trivial over-parameterization branches which provide further accuracy gains. Our basic block builds on the MobileNet-V1 [31] block of 3x3 depthwise convolution followed by 1x1 pointwise convolutions. We then introduce reparameterizable skip connection [13] with batchnorm along with branches that replicate the structure as shown in Figure 3. The trivial over-parameterization factor k is a hyperparameter which is varied from 1 to 5. We ablate over the choice for k in Table 4. At inference, MobileOne model does not have any branches. They are removed using the re-parameterization process described in [12, 13].

For a convolutional layer of kernel size K, input channel dimension Cin and output channel dimension Cout, the weight matrix is denoted as W′ ∈ R Cout×Cin×K×K and bias is denoted as b ′ ∈ R D. A batchnorm layer contains accumulated mean µ, accumulated standard deviation σ, scale γ and bias β. Since convolution and batchnorm at inference are linear operations, they can be folded into a single convolution layer with weights Wc = W′ ∗ γ σ and bias bb = (b ′ − µ) ∗ γ σ + β. Batchnorm is folded into preceding convolutional layer in all the branches. For skip

Figure 3. MobileOne block has two different structures at train time and test time. Left: Train time MobileOne block with reparameterizable branches. Right: MobileOne block at inference where the branches are reparameterized. Either ReLU or SE-ReLU is used as activation. The trivial over-parameterization factor k is a hyperparameter which is tuned for every variant.

To better understand the improvements from using train time re-parameterizable branches, we ablate over versions of MobileOne models by removing train-time reparameterizable branches (see Table 5), while keeping all other training parameters the same as described in Section 4. Using re-parameterizable branches significantly improves performance. To understand the importance of trivial over-parameterization branches, we ablate over the choice of over-parameterization factor k in Table 6. For larger variants of MobileOne, the improvements from trivial overparameterization starts diminishing. For smaller variant like MobileOne-S0, we see improvements of 0.5% by using trivial over-parameterization branches. In Figure 4, we see that adding re-parameterizable branches improves optimization as both train and validation losses are further lowered.

Model Scaling Recent works scale model dimensions like width, depth, and resolution to improve performance [22, 54]. MobileOne has similar depth scaling as MobileNet-V2, i.e. using shallower early stages where input resolution is larger as these layers are significantly slower compared to later stages which operate on smaller input resolution. We introduce 5 different width scales as seen in Table 7. Furthermore, we do not explore scaling up of input resolution as both FLOPs and memory consumption increase, which is detrimental to runtime performance on a mobile device. As our model does not have a multibranched architecture at inference, it does not incur data movement costs as discussed in previous sections. This enables us to aggressively scale model parameters compared to competing multi-branched architectures like MobileNet-V2, EfficientNets, etc. without incurring significant latency cost. The increased parameter count enables our models to generalize well to other computer vision tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation (see Section 4). In Table 4, we compare against recent train time over-parameterization works [11–13, 19] and show that MobileOne-S1 variant outperforms RepVGG-B0 which is ∼3× bigger.

#### 3.4. Training

As opposed to large models, small models need less regularization to combat overfitting. It is important to have weight decay in early stages of training as demonstrated

Figure 4. Plot of train and validation losses of MobileOne-S0 model. From no branches to adding re-parameterizable branches with k=1, leads to 3.4% lower train loss. Adding more branches (k=4) lowers train loss by an additional ∼1%. From no branches to the variant with re-parameterizable branches (k=4), validation loss improves by 3.1%

empirically by [18]. Instead of completely removing weight decay regularization as studied in [18], we find that annealing the loss incurred by weight decay regularization over the course of training is more effective. In all our experiments, we use cosine schedule [42] for learning rate. Further, we use the same schedule to anneal weight decay coefficient. We also use the progressive learning curriculum introduced in [56]. In Table 8, we ablate over the various train settings keeping all other parameters fixed. We see that annealing the weight decay coefficient gives a 0.5% improvement.

#### 3.5. Benchmarking

Getting accurate latency measurements on a mobile device can be difficult. On the iPhone 12, there is no command line access or functionality to reserve all of a compute fabric for just the model execution. We also do not have access to the breakdown of the round-trip-latency into categories like the network initialization, data movement, and network execution. To measure latency, we developed an iOS application using swift [35]. The application runs the models using Core ML [57]. To eliminate startup inconsistencies, the model graph is loaded, the input tensor is preallocated, and the model is run once before benchmarking begins. During benchmarking, the app runs the model many times (default is 1000) and statistic are accumulated. To achieve lowest latency and highest consistency, all other applications on the phone are closed. For the models latency seen in Table 9, we report the full round-trip latency. A large fraction of this time may be from platform processes that are not model execution, but in a real application these delays may be unavoidable. Therefore we chose to include them in the reported latency. In order to filter out interrupts from other processes, we report the minimum latency for all the models. For CPU latency, we run the models on an Ubuntu desktop with a 2.3 GHz – Intel Xeon Gold 5118 processor. For GPU latency, we compile the models using NVIDIA TensorRT library (v8.0.1.6) and run on a single RTX-2080Ti GPU with batch size set to 1. We report the median latency value out of 100 runs.

### 4. Experiments

Image Classification on ImageNet-1K We evaluate MobileOne models on ImageNet [10] dataset, which consists of 1.28 million training images and a validation set with 50,000 images from 1,000 classes. All models are trained from scratch using PyTorch [46] library on a machine with 8 NVIDIA GPUs. All models are trained for 300 epochs with an effective batch size of 256 using SGD with momentum [51] optimizer. We use label smoothing regularization [52] with cross entropy loss with smoothing factor set to 0.1 for all models. The initial learning rate is 0.1 and annealed using a cosine schedule [42]. Initial weight decay coefficient is set to 10−4 and annealed to 10−5 using the same cosine schedule as described in [42]. We use AutoAugment [7] to train only the bigger variants of MobileOne, i.e. S2, S3, and S4. The strength of autoaugmentation and image resolution is progressively increased during training as introduced in [56]. We list the details in supplementary material. For smaller variants of MobileOne, i.e.

S0 and S1 we use standard augmentation – random resized cropping and horizontal flipping. We also use EMA (Exponential Moving Average) weight averaging with decay constant of 0.9995 for training all versions of MobileOne. At test time, all MobileOne models are evaluated on images of resolution 224 × 224. In Table 9, we compare against all recent efficient models that are evaluated on images of resolution 224×224 while having a parameter count <20 Million and trained without distillation as done in prior works like [5,45]. FLOP counts are reported using the fvcore [17] library.

We show that even the smallest variants of transformer architectures have a latency upwards of 4ms on mobile device. Current state-of-the-art MobileFormer [5] attains top-1 accuracy of 79.3% with a latency of 70.76ms, while MobileOne-S4 attains 79.4% with a latency of only 1.86ms which is ∼38× faster on mobile. MobileOne-S3 has 1% better top-1 accuracy than EfficientNet-B0 and is faster by 11% on mobile. Our models have a lower latency even on CPU and GPU compared to competing methods.

Knowledge distillation Efficient models are often distilled from a bigger teacher model to further boost the performance. We demonstrate the performance of MobileOne backbones using state-of-the-art distillation recipe suggested in [48]. From Table 10, our models outperform competing models of similar or higher parameter count. Train-time overparameterization enables our models to distill to better performance even though they have similar or smaller parameter count than competing models. In fact, MobileOne-S4 outperforms even ResNet-50 model which has 72.9% more parameters. MobileOne-S0 has 0.4M less parameters at inference than MobileNetV3-Small and obtains 2.8% better top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k dataset.

Object detection on MS-COCO To demonstrate the versatility of MobileOne, we use it as the backbone feature extractor for a single shot object detector SSD [38]. Following [47], we replace standard convolutions in SSD head with separable convolutions, resulting in a version of SSD called SSDLite. The model is trained using the mmdetection library [3] on the MS COCO dataset [37]. The input resolution is set to 320×320 and the model is trained for 200 epochs as described in [45]. For more detailed hyperparameters please refer to the supplementary material. We report mAP@IoU of 0.50:0.05:0.95 on the validation set of MS COCO in Table 11. Our best model outperforms MNASNet by 27.8% and best version of MobileViT [45] by 6.1%. We show qualitative results in the supplementary material.

Semantic Segmentation on Pascal VOC and ADE 20k We use MobileOne as the backbone for a Deeplab V3 segmentation network [4] using the cvnets library [45]. The VOC models were trained on the augmented Pascal VOC dataset [16] for 50 epochs following the training procedure of [45]. The ADE 20k [65] models were trained using the same hyperparameters and augmentations. For more detailed hyperparameters, please refer to the supplementary

material. We report mean intersection-over-union (mIOU) results in Table 11. For VOC, our model outperforms Mobile ViT by 1.3% and MobileNetV2 by 5.8%. Using the MobileOne-S1 backbone with a lower latency than the MobileNetV2-1.0 backbone, we still outperform it by 2.1%. For ADE 20k, our best variant outperforms MobileNetV2 by 12.0%. Using the smaller MobileOne-S1 backbone, we still outperform it by 2.9%. We show qualitative results in the supplementary material.

Robustness to corruption We evaluate MobileOne and competing models on the following benchmarks, ImageNet-A [28], a dataset that contains naturally occuring examples that are misclassified by resnets. ImageNet-R [25], a dataset that contains natural renditions of ImageNet object classes with different textures and local image statistics. ImageNet-Sketch [59], a dataset that contains black and white sketches of all ImageNet classes, obtained using google image queries. ImageNet-C [26], a dataset that consists of algorithmically generated corruptions (blur, noise) applied to the ImageNet test-set. We follow the protocol set by [44] for all the evaluations. We use pretrained weights provided by Timm Library [60] for the evaluations. From Table 12, MobileOne outperforms other efficient architectures significantly on out-of-distribution benchmarks like ImageNet-R and ImageNet-Sketch. Our model is less robust to corruption when compared to MobileNetV3- L, but outperforms MobileNetV3-L on out-of-distribution benchmarks. Our model outperforms MobileNetV3-S, MobileNetV2 variants and EfficientNet-B0 on both corruption and out-of-distribution benchmarks as seen in Table 12.

Comparison with Micro Architectures Recently [22, 36] introduced architectures that were extremely efficient in terms of FLOPS and parameter count. But architectural choices introduced in these micro architectures like [36], do not always result in lower latency models. MicroNet uses dynamic activations which are extremely inefficient as

demonstrated in Table 2. In fact, smaller variants of MobileOne can easily outperform previous state-of-the-art micro architectures. Please see supplementary materials for more details on MobileOne micro architectures. In Table 13, our models have similar latency as TinyNets, but have significantly lower parameter count and better top-1 accuracy. MobileOne-µ1, is 2× smaller and has 6.3% better top-1 accuracy while having similar latency as TinyNet-E.

### 5. Discussion

We have proposed an efficient, general-purpose backbone for mobile devices. Our backbone is suitable for general tasks such as image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. We show that in the efficient regime, latency may not correlate well with other metrics like parameter count and FLOPs. Furthermore, we analyze the efficiency bottlenecks for various architectural components used in modern efficient CNNs by measuring their latency directly on a mobile device. We empirically show the improvement in optimization bottlenecks with the use of reparameterizable structures. Our model scaling strategy with the use of re-parameterizable structures attains state-of-theart performance while being efficient both on a mobile device and a desktop CPU.

Limitations and Future Work Although, our models are state-of-the-art within the regime of efficient architectures, the accuracy lags large models [39, 40]. Future work will aim at improving the accuracy of these lightweight models. We will also explore the use of our backbone for faster inference on other computer vision applications not explored in this work such as optical flow, depth estimation, 3D reconstruction, etc.

Table 14. Comparison with mobile architectures on Intel Xeon CPU, NVIDIA 2080Ti GPU, iPhone 12 and Pixel-6. "†" denotes models on Pixel-6 TPU, where weights and activations were converted to int8 format. For all other compute platforms, models were evaluated in fp16 format.

### A. Figures

Figure 1 from the main paper has been enlarged in Figures 5, 6, 7.

### B. Benchmarking

We treat MobileNetV3 [30] in a special way since their H-swish operator is optimized for certain hardware platforms and not for others. Howard et al. [30] show that Hswish can obtain similar performance as ReLU when platform specific optimizations are applied. Therefore, while benchmarking for latency, we replace the H-swish layers with ReLU layers and then report the latency of MobileNetV3.

#### B.1. Additional Benchmarks

We have shown the efficiency of our model with comparisons on CPU, desktop GPU (RTX-2080Ti) and Mobile (iPhone 12). Additionally, in Table 14, we port existing architectures to Pixel-6 TPU and compare with our model. We observe that MobileOne achieves state-of-theart accuracy-latency trade-off on TPU as well.

### C. Image Classification

#### C.1. Training details

All models are trained from scratch using PyTorch [46] library on a machine with 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. All models are trained for 300 epochs with an effective batch size of 256 using SGD with momentum [51] optimizer. We follow progressive training curriculum [56] for faster training and better generalization. Throughout training the image resolution and the augmentation strength(α) is gradually increased, see Table 15. The magnitude for augmentations in AutoAugment [7] policy are between 0-9, we simply multiply α with this value to simulate variable strength of autoaugmentation. AutoAugment [7] is used to train only the bigger variants of MobileOne, i.e. S2, S3, and S4. For smaller variants of MobileOne, i.e. S0 and S1 we use standard augmentation – random resized cropping and horizontal flipping. We use label smoothing regularization [52] with cross entropy loss with smoothing factor set to 0.1 for all models. The initial learning rate is 0.1 and annealed using a cosine schedule [42]. Initial weight decay coefficient is set to 10−4 and annealed to 10−5 using the same cosine schedule. We also use EMA (Exponential Moving Average) weight averaging with decay constant of 0.9995 for training all versions of MobileOne.

#### C.2. Analysis of Training Recipes

Recent models introduce their own training recipe including regularization techniques to train them to competitive accuracies. We ablate over some of the commonly used recipes to train EfficientNet, MobileNetV3-L, MixNet-S, MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV1 in Table 16. Mainly, we report the following,

- Results from original training recipes of the respective models. (baselines)
- Results from training the models using recipe used to train MobileOne models.
- Results obtained by adding EMA, Progressive Learning (PL) and Annealing Weight decay (AWD) to the original recipe proposed by respective works.

All runs below have been reproduced using Timm library [60]. For a fair comparison all models are trained for 300 epochs. From Table 16, we observe that our models use less regularization techniques as opposed to competing models like EfficientNet, MobileNetV3-L and MixNet-S to reach competitive accuracies. When we apply our training recipe to the competing models, there is no improvement in models like EfficientNet, MobileNetV3-L and MixNet-S. There are slight improvements in MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV1. However, the accuracy at iso-latency gap between our models is still large. When progressive learning and annealing weight decay is used with baseline recipes, we obtain additional improvements, for example MobileNetV1, gets 1% improvement and MobileNetV2 ×1.4 gets 0.5% improvement.

#### C.3. Sensitivity to Random Seeds

Our model and training runs are stable and give similar performance with different random seeds, see Table 18.

### D. Micro Architectures

In Table 17, we provide specifications for micro variants of MobileOne introduced in Table 13 of main paper. Rather than optimizing for FLOPs, as done in [21, 36] we sample variants that are significantly smaller in parameter count and use trivial overparameterization to train these architectures to competitive accuracies.

#### D.1. Effectiveness of Overparameterization

We find that additional overparameterization branches benefits smaller variants more than it does for larger variants. In our experiments, we found that smaller variants improve consistently with additional overparameterization branches. Note, for all the experiments in Table 19, we use the same hyperparameters as described in Section 4 of main paper.

### E. Object Detection

#### E.1. Training details

SSDLite models were trained for 200 epochs using cosine learning rate schedule with warmup, following [45]. Linear warmup schedule with a warmup ratio of 0.001 for 4500 iterations was used. Image size of 320×320 was used for both training and evaluation, following [45]. We used SGD with momentum optimizer [51] with an initial learning rate of 0.05, momentum of 0.9 and weight decay of 0.0001 for all the models. We use an effective batchsize of 192, following [3]. The models were trained on a machine with 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

#### E.2. Qualitative Results

Visualizations in Figure 8 are generated using image demo.py [3] with default thresholds in MMDetection library [3]. We compare MobileNetV2-SSDLite

### F. Semantic Segmentation

#### F.1. Training details

We use the MobileViT repository [45] to train our semantic segmentation models and adopt their hyperparameter settings. Both VOC and ADE20k segmentation models were trained for 50 epochs using cosine learning rate with a maximum learning rate of 10−4 and minimum learning rate of 10−6 . We use 500 warmup iterations. The segmentation head has a learning rate multiplier of 10. EMA is used with a momentum of 5 × 10−4 . We use AdamW optimizer [41] with weight decay of 0.01. For VOC, the model is trained on both MS-COCO and VOC data simultaneously following Mehta et al [45]. For both VOC and ADE20k, the only augmentations used are random resize, random crop, and horizontal flipping.

#### F.2. Qualitative Results

We provide qualitative results for semantic segmentation in Figure 9. Our method performs better than MobileViT-S-DeepLabV3 as shown. In row 1, we show that MobileViT-S misclassifies background as airplane. In row 2 and row 6, our method is able to resolve fine details such as the leg of the horse and tiny birds. In row 3, MobileViT-S misclassfies the couch. In row 4, our method is able to segment large foreground object at a close-up view. In row 5, our method segments small objects such as the buses.

#### Abstract

We introduce a critical string theory in two dimensions and demonstrate that this theory, viewed as two-dimensional quantum gravity on the worldsheet, is equivalent to a double-scaled matrix integral. The worldsheet theory consists of Liouville CFT with central charge c ≥ 25 coupled to timelike Liouville CFT with central charge 26−c. The double-scaled matrix integral has as its leading density of states the universal Cardy density of primaries in a two-dimensional CFT, thus motivating the name Virasoro minimal string. The duality holds for any value of the continuous parameter c and reduces to the JT gravity/matrix integral duality in the large central charge limit. It thus provides a precise stringy realization of JT gravity. The main observables of the Virasoro minimal string are quantum analogues of the Weil-Petersson volumes, which are computed as absolutely convergent integrals of worldsheet CFT correlators over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces.

By exploiting a relation of the Virasoro minimal string to three-dimensional gravity and intersection theory on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, we are able to give a direct derivation of the duality. We provide many checks, such as explicit numerical — and in special cases, analytic — integration of string diagrams, the identification of the CFT boundary conditions with asymptotic boundaries of the two-dimensional spacetime, and the matching between the leading non-perturbative corrections of the worldsheet theory and the matrix integral. As a byproduct, we discover natural conformal boundary conditions for timelike Liouville CFT.

# Part I Introduction and summary

## 1 Introduction

String theories with a low number of target spacetime dimensions have proven to be valuable laboratories for understanding fundamental aspects of string theory. Rich phenomena such as holographic duality (for reviews, see [1–7]), non-perturbative effects mediated by D-instantons [8–20], and time-dependent stringy dynamics such as rolling tachyons [21–24], persist in low-dimensional string theories yet remain more computationally tractable than in their higher-dimensional counterparts.

At the same time, the direct approach of worldsheet string perturbation theory in the Polyakov formalism of integrating conformal field theory (CFT) correlators over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, while being explicit and familiar, often obscures the underlying simplicity of the physics of the model. For instance, the two-dimensional c = 1 or type 0A/0B string theories admit a simpler description of the spacetime strings in terms of a doublescaled matrix quantum mechanics. Similarly, worldsheet theories of strings propagating in certain AdS3 backgrounds are more simply described in terms of their spacetime boundary CFT2 dual [25–29]. In these examples, the simpler and more illuminating description is the (spacetime) holographic dual.

Another important low-dimensional string theory model is the minimal string [30, 31], whose worldsheet theory is composed of a Virasoro minimal model CFT with central charge c <ˆ 1 and Liouville CFT with c > 25 that together with the bc-ghost system form a critical worldsheet theory. This string model has been a fruitful arena for investigating aspects of two-dimensional quantum gravity and their relation to double-scaled matrix integrals [32–34] (for reviews, see [2, 35]). As a recent example, several works [36–39] have highlighted the (2, p) minimal string as a candidate string-theoretic description of Jackiw–Teitelboim (or linear) dilaton quantum gravity in the p → ∞ limit.

The main purpose of this paper is to investigate a new critical string theory that we will refer to as Virasoro minimal string theory, for reasons to be described below. When viewed as a model of two-dimensional quantum gravity on the worldsheet itself,1 this theory admits several distinct presentations that make its solvability more manifest. The Virasoro minimal

<sup>1</sup>See [40, 41] however, for a target spacetime interpretation of the worldsheet theory (1.1) for the particular case of ˆc = 1 and c = 25 Liouville CFTs, as strings propagating in a two-dimensional cosmological background.

string is defined by the following worldsheet conformal field theory,2

$c\geq25$$\oplus$$\hat{c}\leq1$$\oplus$$\mathfrak{bc}$-ghosts, (1.1) Liouville CFT$\oplus$$\mathfrak{bc}$-ghosts, (1.1)

where ˆc = 26 − c. Importantly, as described in more detail in section 3, the ˆc ≤ 1 Liouville CFT sector of (1.1) is not simply the analytic continuation of the c ≥ 25 Liouville CFT; rather, it is a distinct (non-unitary) solution to the CFT crossing equations for central charge in the range ˆc ≤ 1 that has been independently bootstrapped [42–44]. It has sometimes been referred to as "timelike Liouville CFT" in the literature, and we will adopt that name here.

In contrast to minimal string theory, the Virasoro minimal string (1.1) is a continuous family of critical worldsheet theories labeled by a single parameter c = 1+6(b+b −1 ) 2 ∈ R≥25. Furthermore, the main observables of the theory, worldsheet CFT correlators integrated over moduli space of Riemann surfaces — or quantum volumes of the string worldsheet — have analytic dependence on both the parameter c as well as the "external momenta" Pi labeling the on-shell vertex operator insertions on the worldsheet. For example, we find for the four punctured sphere and the once punctured torus

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{0,4}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4})=\frac{c-13}{24}+P_{1}^{2}+P_{2}^{2}+P_{3}^{2}+P_{4}^{2}\,\quad{\sf V}^{(b)}_{1,1}(P_{1})=\frac{c-13}{576}+\frac{1}{24}P_{1}^{2}.\tag{1.2}$$

Despite their origin as complicated integrals of CFT correlators over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, the resulting quantum volumes are extraordinarily simple functions of the central charge and external momenta. This suggests that the theory admits a much simpler representation. Indeed, in the main part of this paper we will leverage such alternative descriptions to derive relations that make V (b) g,n accessible for arbitrary g and n.

In this paper, we will show that in addition to the worldsheet CFT description (1.1), the Virasoro minimal string admits the following presentations: as a model of dilaton quantum gravity on the two-dimensional worldsheet subject to a sinh-dilaton potential; as a dimensional reduction of a certain sector of three-dimensional gravity; in terms of intersection theory on moduli space of Riemann surfaces; and in terms of a double-scaled matrix integral. These different presentations are summarized in figure 1.

The double-scaled matrix integral is perturbatively fully determined by its leading density of eigenvalues, which is given by

$$\varrho_{0}^{(b)}(E){\rm d}E=2\sqrt{2}\,\frac{\sinh(2\pi b\sqrt{E})\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}\sqrt{E})}{\sqrt{E}}\,{\rm d}E\,\tag{1.3}$$

<sup>2</sup>A brief aside on terminology: we refer to this as "Virasoro minimal string theory" because it is in a sense the minimal critical worldsheet theory involving only ingredients from Virasoro representation theory. Another point of view is that any bosonic string theory without a tachyon defines a minimal string theory. In contrast to the ordinary minimal string, the word "minimal" should not be read as having anything to do with Virasoro minimal model CFTs.

where E is the energy in the double-scaled matrix integral. Since (1.3) is the Cardy formula that universally governs the asymptotic density of states in any unitary compact CFT2, we call (1.1) the Virasoro minimal string. In the limit b → 0 (equivalently c → ∞) and upon rescaling the energy E the eigenvalue density of the Virasoro minimal string reduces to the sinh(√ E) dE density of JT gravity. At finite values of c the Virasoro minimal string (1.1) corresponds to a deformation of JT gravity, which is however completely distinct from the (2, p) minimal string.

Outline of this paper. The rest of the paper is organized in four parts. In the first part we summarize the different presentations of (1.1) and highlight our main results following the structure outlined in figure 1. Part II is split into three sections: In section 3 we define the worldsheet theory (1.1). We describe the spacelike and timelike Liouville conformal field theories corresponding to the theories with central charge c ≥ 25 and ˆc ≤ 1 in the Virasoro minimal string (1.1). We introduce suitable boundary conditions which will allow us to study also configurations with asymptotic boundaries. In section 4 we provide a three-dimensional perspective of the Virasoro minimal string and derive a cohomological interpretation for the quantum volumes V (b) g,n using intersection theory technology on the compactified moduli space of Riemann surfaces, Mg,n. We introduce and discuss the dual matrix model in section 5. Topological recursion demonstrates the equivalence between the matrix model and the intersection theory expressions for V (b) g,n. Part III contains further applications and direct checks of the Virasoro minimal string, such as a discussion of non-perturbative effects in section 6, the direct evaluation of string diagrams in section 7 and string diagrams in the presence of boundaries in section 8. We conclude in part IV with a discussion and a summary of open problems. Details of various calculations and conventions are summarized in appendices A, B, C and D.

## 2 Summary of results

### 2.1 Sinh-dilaton gravity

We begin by considering a two-dimensional theory of dilaton gravity. Its classical Euclidean action on a surface Σ takes the form

$$S_{\Sigma}[g,\Phi]=-\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Sigma}\mathrm{d}^{2}x\,\sqrt{g}\left(\Phi\mathcal{R}+W(\Phi)\right)-\int_{\partial\Sigma}\mathrm{d}x\,\sqrt{h}\,\Phi(K-1)\tag{2.1}$$ $$-\frac{S_{0}}{2\pi}\left(\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Sigma}\mathrm{d}^{2}x\sqrt{g}\,\mathcal{R}+\int_{\partial\Sigma}\mathrm{d}x\,\sqrt{h}K\right)\,\ \ W(\Phi)=\frac{\sinh(2\pi b^{2}\Phi)}{\sin(\pi b^{2})}\.$$

Here S −1 0 plays the role of a gravitational coupling. The model reduces to JT gravity in the limit b → 0, where the dilaton potential becomes linear [45, 46]. The second line in (2.1) is the Euler term which weighs different topologies according to their genus, see e.g. [36]. This theory has been considered before, see e.g. [37, 38, 47–49], but is not yet solvable by standard techniques, since it in particular falls outside the class of dilaton gravities considered in [39,50–52]. We will not discuss the theory directly in the metric formulation. Instead, we will make use of the following field redefinition

$$\phi=b^{-1}\rho-\pi b\Phi\ ,\qquad\chi=b^{-1}\rho+\pi b\Phi\ ,\tag{2.2}$$

where ρ is the Weyl factor of the worldsheet metric g = e2ρ g˜. At the level of the classical actions, this maps the theory to the direct sum of a spacelike Liouville theory of central charge c = 1 + 6(b + b −1 ) 2 and a timelike Liouville theory of central charge ˆc = 26 − c. See [38, 47] for more details. We can thus describe the theory as a two-dimensional string theory with a spacelike Liouville theory coupled to a timelike Liouville theory. The classical actions of spacelike and timelike Liouville theory are respectively given by

$$S_{\rm L}[\phi]=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\Sigma}{\rm d}^{2}x\sqrt{\tilde{g}}\left(\tilde{g}^{ij}\partial_{i}\phi\partial_{j}\phi+Q\widetilde{\cal R}\phi+4\pi\mu_{\rm st}{\rm e}^{2b\phi}\right)\,$$ (2.3a) \[\left.\begin{array}{c}\mbox{\rm\small$\frac{1}{4\pi}$}\int_{\Sigma}{\rm d}^{2}x\sqrt{\tilde{g}}\left(\tilde{g}^{ij}\partial_{i}\phi\partial_{j}\phi+Q\widetilde{\cal R}\phi+4\pi\mu_{\rm st}{\rm e}^{2b\phi}\right)\,\end{array}\right.

$$S_{\rm tL}[\chi]=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\Sigma}{\rm d}^{2}x\sqrt{\tilde{g}}\left(-\tilde{g}^{ij}\partial_{i}\chi\partial_{j}\chi-\widehat{Q}\widehat{\cal R}\chi+4\pi\mu_{\rm tL}{\rm e}^{2b\chi}\right).\tag{2.3b}$$

The dimensionless parameters Q, b and Q, b ˆb and their relation with each other is explained in the next section; µsL and µtL are dimensionful parameters of the theory that satisfy µsL = −µtL. 3 We emphasize that although we have introduced these theories at the level of their worldsheet Lagrangians, in what follows we will treat them as non-perturbatively well-defined conformal field theories that together define the worldsheet CFT.

### 2.2 Worldsheet definition

The most direct description of the Virasoro minimal string is that of a critical bosonic worldsheet theory consisting of spacelike and timelike Liouville conformal field theories with paired central charges c ≥ 25 and ˆc ≤ 1 respectively, together with the usual bc-ghost system with central charge cgh = −26. We emphasize that we view this string theory as a 2d theory of quantum gravity on the worldsheet (as opposed to a theory in target space), as depicted in figure 2.

We refer to Liouville theory with c ≥ 25 as spacelike Liouville theory whereas we refer to Liouville theory with ˆc ≤ 1 as timelike Liouville theory [55–58]. This distinction is important as the CFT data of timelike Liouville theory is not simply the analytic continuation of that of spacelike Liouville theory. In this paper, we will place a typographical hat on quantities that refer to the timelike Liouville sector of the worldsheet theory (1.1) in order to distinguish them from those in the spacelike Liouville sector. We parametrize the central charges and the Virasoro conformal weights of their operator spectra by

spacelike Liouville CFT: $c=1+6Q^{2}\;,\quad Q=b+b^{-1}\;,\quad h_{P}=\dfrac{Q^{2}}{4}+P^{2}\;,$ (2.4a), $$\widehat{\rho_{2}}$$. 

timelike Liouville CFT: $\hat{c}=1-6\widehat{Q}^{2}\;,\quad\widehat{Q}=\hat{b}^{-1}-\hat{b}\;,\quad\hat{h}_{\widehat{P}}=-\frac{\widehat{Q}^{2}}{4}+\widehat{P}^{2}\;.$ (2.4b)

<sup>3</sup> In the references [38, 39, 49, 53, 54], the timelike Liouville factor is replaced by a minimal model at the quantum level which then leads to the usual minimal string. In this paper, we will take the timelike Liouville factor seriously which leads to a completely different theory at the quantum level.

![](_page_9_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 2: A critical string background can be viewed as a model of quantum gravity on the two-dimensional worldsheet of the string, or as a model of strings propagating in target spacetime.

The parameters P and Pb are often referred to as the "Liouville momenta." With this parametrization b and ˆb are real valued and we can choose b, ˆb ∈ (0, 1]. Both spacelike and timelike Liouville CFT are noncompact solutions to the crossing equations with a continuous spectrum of (delta-function normalizable) scalar primary operators with conformal weights bounded from below by c−1 24 and cˆ−1 24 respectively. This corresponds to real values of the Liouville momenta P, Pb. We defer a more comprehensive discussion of these worldsheet CFTs to section 3.1.

The Virasoro minimal string is described on the worldsheet by coupling a spacelike Liouville theory to a timelike Liouville theory, as described classically in (2.2). Vanishing of the conformal anomaly of the combined theory imposes the condition ˆc = 26 − c and thus ˆb = b. The mass shell condition for physical states hP + hˆ Pb = 1 further implies Pb = ±iP. In summary we have

$\hat{b}=b\;,\quad\hat{P}=iP\;,$

where we chose one convention for the sign for concreteness. Hence, on-shell vertex operators in Virasoro minimal string theory involve external primary operators in timelike Liouville CFT with imaginary values of the Liouville momenta. Notably, imaginary values of Pb correspond to hˆ ≤ cˆ−1 24 and are thus not in the spectrum of timelike Liouville theory. Thus we will need to analytically continue the correlation functions of timelike Liouville theory away from real Liouville momenta. In fact this is a harmless operation and, contrary to spacelike Liouville theory, does not require contour deformations in the conformal block decomposition of worldsheet correlators. In [57], such an analytic continuation leads to the distinction of the internal and external spectrum. A similar analytic continuation is also necessary for the usual minimal string — there, primaries of the Virasoro minimal model are combined with vertex operators in Liouville theory that are not in the spectrum and so their correlation functions are necessarily defined by analytic continuation.

We will denote the primary operators in the spacelike/timelike Liouville CFTs of conformal weights hP and hˆ Pb by VP (z) and Vb Pb(z) respectively. Physical operators of the full worldsheet theory are hence represented by the following vertex operators built out of paired primaries of the spacelike and timelike Liouville CFTs, together with bc-ghosts,

$${\cal V}_{P}={\rm N}(P)\,\epsilon\,{\rm c}\,{\rm V}_{P}\,\hat{V}_{\hat{P}=iP}\,\,\,,\tag{2.6}$$

where N(P) is a normalization constant that will be fixed in section 7.

The observables in Virasoro minimal string theory are computed by worldsheet diagrams as usual in string theory. For a worldsheet with genus g and n external punctures we define

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\equiv\int_{{\cal M}_{g,n}}Z_{\rm gh}\langle V_{P_{1}}\ldots V_{P_{n}}\rangle_{g}\langle\widehat{V}_{iP_{1}}\ldots\widehat{V}_{iP_{n}}\rangle_{g}.\tag{2.7}$$

Here ⟨VP1 . . . VPn ⟩g is the correlation function of n primary operators on a genus-g Riemann surface in spacelike Liouville CFT, ⟨VbiP1 . . . VbiPn ⟩g is the corresponding correlator in timelike Liouville CFT, Zgh is the correlator of the bc-ghost system and the worldsheet CFT correlators are integrated over Mg,n, the moduli space of genus-g Riemann surfaces with n punctures. We will typically consider the worldsheet diagrams for real values of the external momenta Pj , but we will see that the analytic continuation to complex momenta is often straightforward. A special feature of the Virasoro minimal string is that at least for real values of the external momenta, these diagrams are absolutely convergent integrals over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. The Liouville momenta Pj play a role analogous to that of the geodesic lengths in JT gravity, with V (b) g,n playing the role of the Weil-Petersson volumes. We shall discuss the precise reduction of V (b) g,n to the Weil-Petersson volumes in section 2.7. For this reason we will refer to V (b) g,n as "quantum volumes." In the full theory of quantum gravity, it is necessary to sum over all topologies which are weighted according to the Euler characteristic. We have

$${\sf V}_{n}^{(b)}(S_{0};P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\equiv\sum_{g=0}^{\infty}{\rm e}^{(2-2g-n)S_{0}}\,{\sf V}_{g,n}^{(b)}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\,\tag{2.8}$$

This sum is asymptotic, but can be made sense of via resurgence.

Given the relationship between the Virasoro minimal string and two-dimensional dilaton gravity, it is natural to anticipate that it can compute observables with asymptotic boundaries in addition to the string diagrams with finite boundaries corresponding to external vertex operator insertions.4 This is achieved on the worldsheet by equipping the worldsheet CFT with particular boundary conditions. We summarize the mechanism by which we incorporate asymptotic boundaries in section 2.5 and the precise worldsheet boundary conformal field theory in section 3.2. We in particular introduce a new family of conformal boundary conditions for timelike Liouville theory — which we dub "half-ZZ" boundary conditions — that will play an important role in the incorporation of asymptotic boundaries and in mediating non-perturbative effects in Virasoro minimal string theory.

### 2.3 Dual matrix integral

The central claim of this paper is that the Virasoro minimal string is dual to a double-scaled Hermitian matrix integral. We will provide evidence that the leading density of states for this double-scaled matrix integral is given by

$$\varrho_{0}^{(b)}(E){\rm d}E=2\sqrt{2}\,\frac{\sinh(2\pi b\sqrt{E})\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}\sqrt{E})}{\sqrt{E}}\,{\rm d}E\ ,\tag{2.9}$$

where E = P 2 = hP − c−1 24 is the energy in the matrix integral. For b → 0, one of the sinh's linearizes and we recover the famous sinh(√ E) dE density of states of JT gravity [36].

(2.9) is the universal normalized Cardy density of states in any unitary CFT2, which is what motivated us to call the bulk theory the Virasoro minimal string. It is the modular S-matrix for the vacuum Virasoro character that controls the high energy growth of states in a CFT2,

$$\chi^{(b)}_{\rm vac}\left(-\frac{1}{\tau}\right)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!1P\,\rho^{(b)}_{0}(P)\,\chi^{(b)}_{P}(\tau)\,\ \ {\rm with}\ \ \rho^{(b)}_{0}(P)\equiv4\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi bP)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}P)\,\tag{2.10}$$

where χ (b) P (τ ) = q P 2 η(τ ) −1 are the non-degenerate Virasoro characters with weight hP . Here τ is the torus modulus, with q = e 2πiτ and η(τ ) the Dedekind eta function. The density of states is directly related to the spectral curve [59] which is the basic data for the topological recursion/loop equations in a double-scaled matrix integral. Since in recent CFT literature and the random matrix theory literature it is common to denote the densities of states by the same Greek letter, we distinguish the two cases by using ρ (b) 0 in the CFT and ϱ (b) 0 (2.9) in the matrix integral context.

The matrix integral associated to (2.9) turns out to be non-perturbatively unstable, unless b = 1. This is diagnosed by computing the first non-perturbative correction to the density

<sup>4</sup> In the JT gravity limit, these finite boundaries become geodesic boundaries with lengths fixed in terms of the data of the vertex operator insertions as in (2.22). For this reason, in a slight abuse of notation, we will sometimes use the terms finite boundaries and geodesic boundaries interchangeably.

of states. Perturbatively, no eigenvalue can be smaller than zero, but non-perturbatively, eigenvalues can tunnel to this classically forbidden regime. The leading non-perturbative contribution to the density of states in the forbidden E < 0 region takes the form

$$\langle\varrho^{(b)}(E)\rangle=-\frac{1}{8\pi E}\exp\left(2\sqrt{2}\,e^{S_{0}}\Big{(}\frac{\sin(2\pi Q\sqrt{-E})}{Q}-\frac{\sin(2\pi\widehat{Q}\sqrt{-E}\,)}{\widehat{Q}}\Big{)}\right)\,,\tag{2.11}$$

where Q and Qb were defined in (2.4). Unless b = 1, this can become arbitrarily large for sufficiently negative E and thus renders the model unstable. One can define a non-perturbative completion of the matrix integral by modifying the integration contour over the eigenvalues of the matrices. Such a non-perturbative completion is ambiguous and any choice requires the inclusion of non-perturbative corrections to the gravity partition functions. These nonperturbative corrections correspond to ZZ-instanton corrections on the worldsheet and will be discussed in section 6.1. The worldsheet exhibits the same non-perturbative ambiguities, presumably related to the choice of integration contour in string field theory [60]. Via resurgence, the computation of non-perturbative effects allows us also to extract the large-genus asymptotics of the quantum volumes,

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,h}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\stackrel{{g>1}}{{\approx}}\frac{\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{\sqrt{2}\sin(2\pi b^{j})}{P_{j}}}{2^{\frac{1}{2}}\pi^{\frac{1}{2}}(1-b^{j})^{\frac{1}{2}}}\times\left(\frac{4\sqrt{2}b\sin(\pi b^{2})}{1-b^{4}}\right)^{2-2g-n}\times\Gamma\big{(}2g+n-\frac{5}{2}\big{)}.\tag{2.12}$$

### 2.4 Deformed Mirzakhani recursion relation

Our conjecture for the dual matrix integral leads to recursion relations for the quantum volumes V (b) g,n. In particular we have

P1V (b) g,n(P1, P) = Z ∞ 0 (2P dP) (2P ′ dP ′ ) H(P + P ′ , P1) V (b) g−1,n+1(P, P′ , P) + X g h=0 X I⊔J={2,...,n} V (b) h,|I|+1(P, PI )V (b) g−h,|J|+1(P ′ , PJ ) + Xn i=2 Z ∞ 0 (2P dP) H(P, P1 + Pi) + H(P, P1 − Pi) V (b) g,n−1 (P, P \ Pi) , (2.13)

where P = (P2, . . . , Pn). The different terms correspond to the three topologically different ways in which one can embed a three-punctured sphere with boundary P1 into Σg,n. They are displayed in figure 3. The function H(x, y) takes the following form

$$H(x,y)=\frac{y}{2}-\int_{0}^{\infty}{\rm d}t\,\frac{\sin(4\pi tx)\sin(4\pi ty)}{\sinh(2\pi bt)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}t)}.\tag{2.14}$$

![](_page_13_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 3: The three different ways of embedding a three-punctured sphere into a surface, corresponding to the three different contributions in eq. (2.13).

The integral over t is not elementary, except in special cases. For example, we have for b = 1

$$H(x,y)\big{|}_{b=1}=\frac{-y\cosh(2\pi y)+x\sinh(2\pi y)+y\,{\rm e}^{-2\pi x}}{4\sinh(\pi(x+y))\sinh(\pi(x-y))}.\tag{2.15}$$

This is a deformed version of Mirzakhani's celebrated recursion relation [61] to which it reduces in the limit b → 0. We wrote an efficient implementation of this recursion relation in Mathematica, which is appended as an ancillary file to the submission.

### 2.5 Asymptotic boundaries

So far, we have only explained how to efficiently compute gravity partition functions with finite boundaries. One can add asymptotic boundaries just like in JT gravity by computing the partition function of a disk and of a punctured disk (aka trumpet) and glue them to the bulk volumes.

The disk and trumpet partition function take the form

$${\cal Z}^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(\beta)={\rm e}^{\frac{\pi^{2}}{b\beta}}\prod_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{1}{1-{\rm e}^{-\frac{4\pi^{2}n}{\beta}}}=\frac{1}{\eta(\frac{\beta_{1}}{2\pi})}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\beta}}\left({\rm e}^{\frac{\pi^{2}\alpha^{2}}{\beta}}-{\rm e}^{\frac{\pi^{2}\beta^{2}}{\beta}}\right)\;,\tag{2.16a}$$

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm rrumpet}(\beta;P)={\rm e}^{-\frac{4\pi^{2}}{\beta}(P^{2}-\frac{1}{2^{4}})}\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{1-{\rm e}^{-\frac{4\pi^{2}n}{\beta}}}=\frac{1}{\eta(\frac{\beta n}{2^{n}})}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\beta}}\,{\rm e}^{-\frac{4\pi^{2}p^{2}}{\beta}}.\tag{2.16b}$$

From the first expression, one can recognize that these partition functions are simply the Virasoro vacuum character and non-vacuum character in the dual channel, respectively. In the second expression, we used the modular properties of the eta-function to rewrite it in terms of the β channel.

The reason why the Virasoro character appears is that these 2d gravity partition functions are actually equal to a partition function of a chiral half of three-dimensional gravity theory on Σg,n × S 1 . We will explain this in section 4, where we derive these formulas. In our convention of β, the size of the thermal circle is 4π 2 β . Thus, for the disk, we are actually computing the chiral 3d gravity partition function on a solid cylinder which gives the vacuum Virasoro character in the boundary. Similarly the trumpet partition function is equal to the 3d gravity partition function on a solid cylinder with a black hole inside, which gives a generic Virasoro character in the boundary.

The dual matrix integral explained in section 2.3 only captures the partition function of primaries. This should be intuitively clear since Virasoro descendants are dictated by symmetry and thus cannot be statistically independent from the primaries. We account for this by stripping off the factor η( βi 2π ) and denote the primary partition functions by Z (b) . Thus we have

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(\beta)=\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\beta}}\left({\rm e}^{\frac{\pi^{2}Q^{2}}{\beta}}-{\rm e}^{\frac{\pi^{2}\tilde{Q}^{2}}{\beta}}\right)\tag{2.17a}$$ $$\left(\beta,P\right)=\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\beta}}\ \ -\frac{4\pi^{2}P^{2}}{\beta}\tag{2.17b}$$

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm trumpet}(\beta;P)=\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\beta}}\;{\rm e}^{-\frac{4\pi^{2}P^{2}}{\beta}}\;.\tag{2.17b}$$

The trumpet partition function has the same form as in JT gravity [36]. Taking the inverse Laplace transform of the disk partition function of the primaries Z (b) disk leads to the eigenvalue distribution ϱ (b) 0 given in equation (2.9), see subsection 5.2 for more details.

We can then compute the partition function with any number of asymptotic boundaries as follows

$$Z^{(b)}_{g,n}(\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{n})=\int_{0}^{\infty}\prod_{j=1}^{n}\left(2P_{j}\,{\rm d}P_{j}\,Z^{(b)}_{\rm trumpet}(\beta_{j},P_{j})\right){\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n}).\tag{2.18}$$

Notice that the same measure 2P dP appears as in the deformed Mirzakhani's recursion relation (2.13). We derive this gluing measure from 3d gravity in section 4.1. Up to normalization, this is the same measure as in JT gravity. The gluing procedure is sketched in figure 4.

### 2.6 Intersection theory on moduli space

There is a last way to describe the theory – in terms of intersection theory on the compactified moduli space of Riemann surfaces Mg,n. This forms the conceptual bridge between the worldsheet description of section 2.2 and the description in terms of a random matrix integral in section 2.3 and allows us to essentially derive the duality.

From a bulk perspective, this also gives a far more efficient way to compute the integrals over Mg,n defined in (2.7), thanks to efficient algorithms to compute intersection numbers on

![](_page_15_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 4: Gluing trumpets to the bulk gives the partition function of the Virasoro minimal string on arbitrary topologies with asymptotic boundaries.

moduli space. We used admcycles [62] in practice. We obtain with the intersection theory approach for example

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{0,4}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{4})=\frac{c-13}{24}+\sum_{j=1}^{4}P_{j}^{2}\,\tag{2.19a}$$

$${\sf V}_{1,1}^{(0)}(P_{1})=\frac{1}{24}\left(\frac{c-13}{24}+P_{1}^{2}\right)\,\tag{2.19b}$$

$$\mathsf{V}_{0,5}^{(0)}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{5})=\frac{5c^{2}-130c+797}{1152}+\frac{c-13}{8}\sum_{j=1}^{5}P_{j}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^{5}P_{j}^{4}+2\sum_{j<k}P_{j}^{2}P_{k}^{2}\,\tag{2.19c}$$

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{1,2}(P_{1},P_{2})=\frac{c^{2}-26c+153}{9216}+\frac{c-13}{288}(P_{1}^{2}+P_{2}^{2})+\frac{1}{48}(P_{1}^{2}+P_{2}^{2})^{2}.\tag{2.19d}$$

These can of course also be obtained from the recursion (2.13). We have compiled a much larger list of quantum volumes in appendix B.

Our main claim, which connects the worldsheet and matrix integral descriptions of the Virasoro minimal string, is that V (b) g,n(P1, . . . , Pn) defined in eq. (2.7) is given by the following intersection number of Mg,n:

$$\mathsf{V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})=\int_{\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}}\mathrm{td}(\mathcal{M}_{g,n})\,\exp\left(\frac{c}{24}\,\kappa_{1}+\sum_{j=1}^{n}\left(P_{j}^{2}-\frac{1}{24}\right)\psi_{j}\right)\tag{2.20}$$ $$=\int_{\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}}\exp\left(\frac{c-13}{24}\,\kappa_{1}+\sum_{j=1}^{n}P_{j}^{2}\psi_{j}-\sum_{m\geq1}\frac{B_{2m}}{(2m)(2m)!}\,\kappa_{2m}\right)\,.$$

Here, ψj and κn are standard cohomology classes on Mg,n whose definition we briefly recall in appendix A. B2m are the Bernoulli numbers. The Todd class of the tangent bundle of moduli space that appears in the first line, can be rewritten in terms of the ψ- and κ-classes via the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem, which leads to the expression in the second line.5 Note that the integrand should be viewed as a formal power series. We expand the exponential and pick out the terms of the top degree 3g − 3 + n and integrate them over moduli space.

It is straightforward to derive two identities from (2.20) which are the analogue of the dilaton and string (or puncture) equations of topological gravity [63–65]. This requires some algebraic geometry and the proof can be found in appendix D. They take the form

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n+1}(P=\frac{iQ}{2},{\sf P})-{\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n+1}(P=\frac{iQ}{2},{\sf P})=(2g-2+n){\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}({\sf P})\,\tag{2.21a}$$ $$\int_{\frac{iQ}{2}}^{\frac{iQ}{2}}2P\,{\rm d}P\ {\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n+1}(P,{\sf P})=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\int_{0}^{P_{j}}2P_{j}\,{\rm d}P_{j}\ {\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}({\sf P}).\tag{2.21b}$$

j=1

To state these formulas, one has to analytically continue the quantum volumes to complex values of Pi . We used the parametrization (2.4). These two equations together with polynomiality of the quantum volumes that follows from the intersection expression (2.20) determine them completely at genus 0 and 1 [63].

### 2.7 Relation to JT gravity and the minimal string

2

As already noticed at the level of the action (2.1) or the density of states for the dual matrix integral (2.9), the Virasoro minimal string reduces to JT gravity in the limit b → 0. JT gravity has been studied extensively in the literature, see [36] and many subsequent works. This reduction precisely realizes an idea of Seiberg and Stanford about the relation between the minimal string and JT gravity [37].

Let us make this precise at the level of the quantum volumes V (b) g,n and the partition functions Z (b) g,n. In the limit b → 0, one has to scale the Liouville momenta like

$P=\frac{\ell}{4\pi b}$,

where ℓ are the geodesic lengths on hyperbolic surfaces. This relation is further explained in section 4.2. We also scale the boundary temperatures as follows,

$$\beta=\frac{1}{b^{2}}\,\beta^{\rm JT}\tag{2.23}$$

<sup>5</sup>Here it is important whether we talk about the Todd class of the tangent bundle of Mg,n or Mg,n, since they differ in their behaviour near the boundary of moduli space. We will mention further details about this subtlety in section 4.2.

and hold β JT fixed in the limit b → 0. From the intersection point of view (2.20), it is obvious that the quantum volumes reduce to the ordinary Weil-Petersson volumes by using eq. (A.6) and the fact that the Todd class becomes subleading in this limit. We have

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\stackrel{{b\to0}}{{\longrightarrow}}(8\pi^{2}b^{2})^{-3g+3-n}V_{g,n}(\ell_{1},\ldots,\ell_{n})\big{(}1+{\cal O}(b^{2})\big{)}\,\tag{2.24}$$

where Vg,n denote the Weil-Petersson volumes. In the presence of asymptotic boundaries, we have6

$$Z^{(b)}_{g,n}(\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{n})\stackrel{{b\to0}}{{\longrightarrow}}\big{(}8\pi^{2}b^{2}\big{)}^{\frac{3}{2}(2-2g-n)}Z^{\rm JT}_{g,n}(\beta_{1}^{\rm JT},\ldots,\beta_{n}^{\rm JT}).\tag{2.25}$$

The prefactor is raised to the Euler characteristic and hence can be absorbed into the definition of S0 in (2.1).

One might also wonder whether the Virasoro minimal string is related to the (2, p) minimal string which also admits a double-scaled dual matrix integral description [66–68]. Moreover, there are hints that the (2, p) minimal model could be obtained from timelike Liouville theory on the worldsheet by a certain gauging [69,70]. It has also been argued that the large p limit of the minimal string reduces to the JT gravity, albeit in the regime where vertex operators correspond to conical defect insertions instead of geodesic boundaries [37–39,52,54]. However, let us emphasize that the (2, p) minimal string and the Virasoro minimal string correspond to two completely different deformations of JT gravity and do not seem to have a direct relation. In particular the density of states of the dual matrix integrals are genuinely different.

<sup>6</sup>Here we are using standard conventions in JT gravity. In the language of [36], we set α = 1 and γ = 1 2 .

# Part II Dual descriptions

## 3 A worldsheet perspective

In this section we elucidate in more detail the worldsheet description of the Virasoro minimal string. Throughout we emphasize the exact formulation of the worldsheet CFTs in terms of their operator spectrum and OPE data.

### 3.1 Description of the worldsheet CFT

Spacelike Liouville CFT. Spacelike Liouville CFT is a non-perturbative solution to the CFT crossing equations that exists for all complex values of the central charge c away from the half-line (−∞, 1]. It defines a unitary CFT only if the central charge is real and satisfies c > 1. Its spectrum consists of a continuum of scalar Virasoro primary operators VP with conformal weights lying above the threshold Q2 4 = c−1 24 as parameterized in (2.4). It is a non-compact solution to the bootstrap equations, meaning that the identity operator is not a normalizable operator in the spectrum of the theory.7 There is significant evidence that Liouville CFT is the unique unitary CFT with c > 1 whose spectrum consists of only scalar Virasoro primaries (and indeed with primaries of bounded spins) [71–73].

The structure constants of Liouville CFT were famously bootstrapped by [74–77], and are given by the well-known DOZZ formula. In this work we find it convenient to adopt operator normalization conventions such that the DOZZ formula is equivalent to the universal formula

<sup>7</sup>The "spectrum" of Liouville CFT is a somewhat ambiguous notion; although sub-threshold operators are not (delta-function) normalizable in Liouville theory, we will see that one can often analytically continue observables in the theory to arbitrary values of the external Liouville momenta, corresponding for example to sub-threshold values of the conformal weights. However the fact that sub-threshold operators are nonnormalizable means that they do not appear as internal states in the conformal block decomposition of generic observables, and for this reason we reserve the term "spectrum" for the normalizable, above-threshold operators.

Cb that governs the asymptotics of CFT structure constants [73], namely8

$$\langle V_{P_{1}}(0)V_{P_{2}}(1)V_{P_{3}}(\infty)\rangle=C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3})\equiv\frac{\Gamma_{b}(2Q)\Gamma_{b}(\frac{Q}{2}\pm iP_{1}\pm iP_{2}\pm iP_{3})}{\sqrt{2}\Gamma_{b}(Q)^{3}\prod_{k=1}^{3}\Gamma_{b}(Q\pm2iP_{k})}.\tag{3.1}$$

Here Γb denotes the meromorphic double gamma function (see appendix C for a compendium of properties and representations of Γb) and the ± notation indicates a product over all eight possible sign choices. As an example Γb( Q 2 ±iP1 ±iP2 ±iP3) is a product over eight different factors. This in particular has the feature that it is invariant under reflections Pj → −Pj of the Liouville momenta. Although it is not a normalizable operator in the spectrum of Liouville theory, the identity operator is obtained by analytic continuation P → iQ 2 ≡ 1. The two-point function inherited from (3.1) is then given by

$$\langle V_{P_{1}}(0)V_{P_{2}}(1)\rangle=C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},1)=\frac{1}{\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P_{1})}(\delta(P_{1}-P_{2})+\delta(P_{1}+P_{2})).\tag{3.2}$$

Here ρ (b) 0 is given by the universal formula

$$\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)=4\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi bP)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}P).\tag{3.3}$$

Both the two-point function and the three-point function of Liouville CFT are universal quantities in two-dimensional conformal field theory. The reason for this is that they are crossing kernels for conformal blocks involving the identity operator. We have already seen in section 2.3 that ρ (b) 0 is the modular crossing kernel for the torus vacuum character, which is asymptotic to Cardy's formula for the universal density of high-energy states in a unitary compact 2d CFT. Similarly, Cb — which describes the asymptotic structure constants of high-energy states in a unitary compact 2d CFT — is the crossing kernel for the sphere four-point conformal block describing the exchange of the identity Virasoro Verma module:

![](_page_19_Figure_7.jpeg)

The diagrams on the left- and right-hand sides of the above equation are respectively meant to denote the t- and s-channel Virasoro conformal blocks for the sphere four-point function of pairwise identical operators with conformal weights hP1 and hP2 .

<sup>8</sup>This function has been referred to as C0 in the recent CFT literature. Here we find it convenient to make the dependence on the central charge explicit. Also we find it appropriate to reserve the 0 subscript for ρ (b) 0 , which plays the role of the leading density of eigenvalues in the matrix model, whereas in the present application Cb is an exact CFT three-point function.

Together, this data is sufficient to compute any correlation function of local operators on any closed Riemann surface. This is achieved by the conformal block decomposition as follows:

$$\langle V_{P_{1}}\cdots V_{P_{n}}\rangle_{g}=\int_{\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}}\left(\prod_{a}\mathrm{d}P_{a}\,\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P_{a})\right)\left(\prod_{(j,k,l)}C_{b}(P_{j},P_{k},P_{l})\right)|\mathcal{F}_{g,n}^{(b)}(\mathbf{P}^{\mathrm{ext}};\mathbf{P}|\mathbf{m})|^{2}\;.\tag{3.5}$$

Here F (b) g,n are the genus-g n-point Virasoro conformal blocks with central charge c = 1+6Q2 , Q = b + b −1 ; Pext = (P1, . . . , Pn) denote the external Liouville momenta, and P and m collectively denote the 3g − 3 + n internal Liouville momenta Pa and the worldsheet moduli respectively. Left implicit in the definition of the conformal block is the choice of a channel C of the conformal block decomposition, which is specified by a decomposition of the worldsheet Riemann surface into 2g − 2 + n pairs of pants sewn along 3g − 3 + n cuffs, together with a choice of dual graph. The conformal block decomposition of the resulting correlator includes a factor of ρ (b) 0 for each internal weight corresponding to the complete set of states inserted at each cuff, and a factor of Cb for each pair of pants corresponding to the CFT structure constants. The resulting correlator is independent of the choice of channel in the conformal block decomposition because Liouville CFT solves the crossing equations.

A priori, for fixed worldsheet moduli, the correlation function (3.5) is a function defined for real external Liouville momenta Pext in the spectrum of the theory. However, the structure constants Cb are meromorphic functions of the Liouville momenta and we can readily consider the analytic continuation of (3.5) to complex Pext. But there may be subtleties in this analytic continuation. Even restricting to real values of the conformal weights, if the external operators have weights sufficiently below the threshold c−1 24 , then poles of the structure constants cross the contour of integration and the contour must be deformed such that the conformal block decomposition picks up additional discrete contributions associated with the residues of these poles. This can happen for example whenever there is a pair of external momenta Pj , Pk such that |Im(Pj ± Pk)| > Q 2 .

Timelike Liouville CFT. Timelike Liouville CFT is a solution to the CFT crossing equations for all values of the central charge on the half-line ˆc ≤ 1. Although less well-known than (and with some peculiar features compared to) spacelike Liouville theory, it furnishes an equally good solution to the CFT bootstrap that has been developed from various points of view over the years [43, 44, 56, 57, 78]. It is essential that timelike Liouville CFT is not given by the analytic continuation of spacelike Liouville theory to c ≤ 1, although as we will see the CFT data of the two theories are related.

Similarly to spacelike Liouville theory, the spectrum of timelike Liouville theory consists of a continuum of scalar Virasoro primaries Vb Pb with conformal weights hˆ Pb ≥ cˆ−1 24 = − Qb2 4

parameterized as in (2.4).9 Unlike spacelike Liouville theory, timelike Liouville theory with c <ˆ 1 never defines a unitary CFT in the sense that the spectrum contains primaries with negative conformal weights that violate the unitarity bound. Nevertheless, we will see that the structure constants of the theory are real in the cases of interest.

We adopt conventions such that the structure constants in timelike Liouville CFT are given by the inverse of an analytic continuation of the spacelike structure constants (3.1), in particular [43, 44, 56, 78, 79] .

$$\langle\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{1}}(0)\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{2}}(1)\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{3}}(\infty)\rangle=\widehat{C}_{\hat{b}}(\widehat{P}_{1},\widehat{P}_{2},\widehat{P}_{3})$$ $$\equiv\frac{1}{C_{\hat{b}}(i\widehat{P}_{1},i\widehat{P}_{2},i\widehat{P}_{3})}$$ $$=\frac{\sqrt{2}\Gamma_{b}(\hat{b}+\hat{b}^{-1})^{3}}{\Gamma_{b}(2\hat{b}+2\hat{b}^{-1})}\,\frac{\prod_{k=1}^{3}\Gamma_{b}(\hat{b}+\hat{b}^{-1}\pm2\widehat{P}_{k})}{\Gamma_{b}(\frac{\hat{b}\pm\hat{b}^{-1}}{2}\pm\widehat{P}_{1}\pm\widehat{P}_{2}\pm\widehat{P}_{3})}.\tag{3.6}$$

With a suitable contour of integration of the internal Liouville momenta in the conformal block decomposition that we will discuss shortly, correlation functions in timelike Liouville CFT with these structure constants have been shown to solve the CFT crossing equations numerically [78,80], see also [40]. We note in passing that although the spectrum of timelike Liouville contains a weight zero operator (with Pb = Qb 2 ), it is not the degenerate representation corresponding to the identity operator; indeed the two-point function is not obtained by analytic continuation of (3.6) to Pb3 = Qb 2 . The latter is instead given by

$$\langle\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{1}}(0)\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{2}}(1)\rangle=\frac{2\rho_{0}^{(\hat{b})}(i\widehat{P})}{(i\widehat{P})^{2}}(\delta(\widehat{P}_{1}-\widehat{P}_{2})+\delta(\widehat{P}_{1}+\widehat{P}_{2})).\tag{3.7}$$

Correlation functions in timelike Liouville CFT are then computed by the following conformal block decomposition

$$\langle\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{1}}\cdots\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{n}}\rangle_{\theta}=\int_{\cal C}\prod_{a}\frac{{\rm d}\widehat{P}_{a}\left(i\widehat{P}_{a}\right)^{2}}{2\rho_{0}^{(b)}(i\widehat{P}_{a})}\Bigg{(}\prod_{(j,k,l)}\frac{1}{C_{b}(i\widehat{P}_{j},i\widehat{P}_{k},i\widehat{P}_{l})}\Bigg{)}|{\cal F}_{\theta,n}^{(b)}(\widehat{\bf P}^{\rm ext};\widehat{\bf P}|{\bf m})|^{2}\,\tag{3.8}$$

where C denotes the contour R + iε, ε > 0 (see figure 5). It warrants further emphasis that the contour of integration over the internal Liouville momenta Pb in the conformal block decomposition of the timelike Liouville correlation function is shifted by an amount ε above

<sup>9</sup>Sometimes states with purely imaginary Pb are described as the spectrum of timelike Liouville theory, since they turn out to be natural from the point of view of the Lagrangian formulation of the theory. Here we will reserve that terminology for operators that appear in the conformal block decomposition of correlation functions.

the real axis. Such a shift is required to avoid the infinitely many poles of the timelike Liouville structure constants on the real Pb axis at

poles of $\widehat{C}_{\hat{b}}$: $$\widehat{P}_{j}=\pm\frac{1}{2}\left((m+1)\hat{b}+(n+1)\hat{b}^{-1}\right),\ m,n\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq0}\.$$ (3.9)

These are the only singularities of Cbˆb in the complex Pbi plane. Similarly, the ˆc ≤ 1 Virasoro conformal blocks have poles on the real Pbi axis corresponding to degenerate representations of the Virasoro algebra

poles of ${\cal F}$: $$\widehat{P}_{j}=\pm\frac{1}{2}\left((r+1)\hat{b}-(s+1)\hat{b}^{-1}\right),\ r,s\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq0}\;.$$ (3.10)

Together with the poles of the measure, the integrand has then poles for

$$\hat{P}_{j}=\frac{m}{2}\hat{b}+\frac{n}{2}\hat{b}^{-1}\,\ \ (m,n)\in\mathbb{Z}^{2}\setminus\{(0,0)\}\,\tag{3.11}$$

which for ˆb 2 ̸∈ Q is a dense set on the real line.

Since the location of the poles in the internal Liouville momenta are independent of the external Liouville momenta, analytic continuation of the timelike Liouville correlators to complex values of the external momenta Pbext is straightforward, and does not require the further contour deformations that are sometimes needed for analytic continuation of the spacelike Liouville correlators. Indeed, in the Virasoro minimal string we will mostly be interested in the case that the external operators have imaginary timelike Liouville momentum.

The need to shift the OPE contour as described above is perhaps an unfamiliar aspect of timelike Liouville theory. It renders the notion of the spectrum of timelike Liouville somewhat ambiguous, since we may freely deform the OPE contour provided that the poles (3.9), (3.10) on the real axis are avoided. One may wonder about the possibility of different OPE contours. For example, although states with imaginary Liouville momentum are from some points of view natural in timelike Liouville theory, it is clear that with a vertical contour the conformal block decomposition would badly diverge, since with that prescription the OPE would contain internal states with arbitrarily negative conformal dimension. With this prescription where the OPE contour runs parallel to the real axis, the correlation functions of timelike Liouville CFT have been shown to solve the bootstrap equations numerically [40, 78]. Since it satisfies these basic CFT consistency conditions, our view is that despite some subtleties (including non-unitarity of the spectrum) timelike Liouville theory is nonperturbatively well-defined as a CFT in the same sense as spacelike Liouville theory.

The Virasoro minimal string background. Equipped with our knowledge of the OPE data of spacelike and timelike Liouville theories that together with the bc-ghost system defines the worldsheet CFT of the Virasoro minimal string, we can now proceed to compute

Poles in the Pb-integrand, coming from the three-point coefficient (3.9) as well as the Virasoro conformal blocks (3.10), are marked with crosses. The contour C runs parallel to the real axis and shifted vertically by a small ε > 0 amount in the imaginary direction in order to avoid the poles. Due to the reflection symmetry of the timelike Liouville structure constant (3.6), the contour C could also be shifted vertically by a small ε < 0.

string worldsheet diagrams as usual in string theory. On-shell vertex operators VP (2.6) are labelled by a single Liouville momentum P and are defined by combining primaries in spacelike and timelike Liouville CFT with the bc-ghosts as in (2.6). In string perturbation theory, the observables are string worldsheet diagrams V (b) g,n(P1, . . . , Pn) ("quantum volumes"), which we define by integrating correlation functions of the worldsheet CFT over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces as outlined in (2.7).

Let us pause to briefly comment on the convergence properties of the moduli integral (2.7) that defines the string worldsheet diagrams that we compute in this paper. In string perturbation theory one often has to worry about divergences in the integrals over worldsheet moduli space that define string diagrams due to intermediate states going on shell. These divergences are associated with particular degenerations in moduli space — for instance, the genus-g worldsheet may split into two components Σg,n → Σg1,n1+1∪Σg2,n2+1 with g = g1+g2 and n = n1 + n2, or in the case of non-separating degenerations, in which a handle pinches and the genus of the worldsheet drops by one but remains connected. The behaviour of the worldsheet integrand near such degenerations is sensitive to the exchange of the lightest operators in the spectrum of the worldsheet CFT. In the Virasoro minimal string theory, the absence of the identity operator (in other words, the non-compact nature of the worldsheet CFT) and the scaling dimensions of the lightest operators in spacelike and timelike Liouville CFT ensure that the resulting moduli integral is in fact absolutely convergent in degenerating limits. We see this explicitly in the case of the torus one-point and sphere four-point diagrams discussed in sections 7.1 and 7.2.

Let us make this more concrete with an example. Consider for instance the moduli integrand in the sphere four-point diagram V (b) 0,4 (P1, . . . , P4), which is computed by integrating the sphere four-point functions of spacelike and timelike Liouville CFT over the complex cross-ratio plane:10

$${\bf V}^{(b)}_{0,4}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{4})=\int_{\mathbb{C}}{\rm d}^{2}z\,\langle V_{P_{1}}\cdots V_{P_{4}}\rangle\langle\widehat{V}_{iP_{1}}\cdots\widehat{V}_{iP_{4}}\rangle.\tag{3.12}$$

We will be interested in the behaviour of the worldsheet integrand in the limit in which two of the vertex operators, say those corresponding to the momenta P1 and P2, coincide. In this degeneration limit the sphere four-point Virasoro blocks can be approximated by the leading term in the small cross-ratio expansion

$${\cal F}^{(b)}_{0,4}({\bf P}^{\rm ext};P|z)\approx z^{P2-P_{1}^{2}-P_{2}^{2}-\frac{Q^{2}}{4}}.\tag{3.13}$$

In this limit the OPE integrals appearing in the spacelike and timelike Liouville four-point functions will be dominated by the P, Pb ≈ 0 regions,11 for which we have

$$\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)\approx16\sqrt{2}\pi^{2}P^{2}.\tag{3.14}$$

Hence we can approximate the sphere four-point functions of spacelike and timelike Liouville CFT as follows in the degeneration limit

$$\langle V_{P_{1}}\cdots V_{P_{4}}\rangle\stackrel{{z\to0}}{{\approx}}\frac{2\pi^{\frac{5}{2}}C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},0)C_{b}(P_{3},P_{4},0)|z|^{-2P_{1}^{2}-2P_{2}^{2}-\frac{Q^{2}}{2}}}{(-\log|z|)^{\frac{3}{2}}}$$ $$\langle\widehat{V}_{iP_{1}}\cdots\widehat{V}_{iP_{4}}\rangle\stackrel{{z\to0}}{{\approx}}\frac{|z|^{2P_{1}^{2}+2P_{2}^{2}+\frac{Q^{2}}{2}}}{64\pi^{\frac{3}{2}}(-\log|z|)^{\frac{1}{2}}C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},0)C_{b}(P_{3},P_{4},0)}.\tag{3.15a}$$

In particular the product of four-point functions that appears in the moduli integrand has the following behaviour in the degeneration limit

$$\langle V_{P_{1}}\cdots V_{P_{4}}\rangle\langle\widehat{V}_{iP_{1}}\cdots\widehat{V}_{iP_{4}}\rangle\stackrel{{z\to0}}{{\approx}}\frac{\pi|z|^{-2}}{32(-\log|z|)^{2}}\,\tag{3.16}$$

and thus the moduli integral (3.12) receives convergent contributions from the degeneration limit locally of the form

$$\int_{\mathbb{C}}\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}z}{|z|^{2}(-\log|z|)^{2}}.\tag{3.17}$$

<sup>10</sup>In what follows we will typically omit the explicit dependence on the worldsheet moduli of the worldsheet CFT correlators for brevity of notation. For example below we have ⟨VP1 · · · VP4 ⟩ = ⟨VP1 (0)VP2 (z)VP3 (1)VP4 (∞)⟩.

<sup>11</sup>Here we are assuming that the external Liouville momenta are such that the contour in the conformal block decomposition does not need to be deformed. This is always the case for real Liouville momenta.

Similar considerations apply to all other degeneration limits of the sphere four-point diagram (which can be studied exactly analogously by working in different OPE channels), and to degeneration limits of more complicated observables. It is interesting to compare eq. (3.16) with the leading behaviour of the Weil-Petersson volume form, which appears in JT gravity. Using the explicit form ωWP = dℓ ∧ dθ of the Weil-Petersson form in Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates [81] and the leading relation

$$\ell\sim\frac{2\pi^{2}}{-\log|z|}\,\qquad\frac{2\pi\theta}{\ell}\sim\arg(z)\tag{3.18}$$

between z and the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates, gives the leading behaviour [82]

$$\omega_{\rm WP}\sim\frac{8\pi^{3}i\,{\rm d}z\wedge{\rm d}\bar{z}}{|z|^{2}(-\log|z|)^{3}}\,\tag{3.19}$$

which is slightly faster decaying than (3.16).

A trivial worldsheet diagram. As a trivial example, let us consider the three-punctured sphere. In this case there are no moduli to integrate over, and the three-point diagram is simply given by the product of the corresponding structure constants in spacelike and timelike Liouville theory given by (3.1) and (3.6) respectively. On the solution to the massshell condition (2.5) the sphere three-point diagram is then simply given by

$${\sf V}_{0,3}^{(b)}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3})\equiv C_{\rm S^{2}}\langle{\cal V}_{P_{1}}(0){\cal V}_{P_{2}}(1){\cal V}_{P_{3}}(\infty)\rangle\tag{3.20}$$ $$=C_{\rm S^{2}}{\sf N}(P_{1}){\sf N}(P_{2}){\sf N}(P_{3})C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3})\widehat{C}_{b}(iP_{1},iP_{2},iP_{3})$$ $$=C_{\rm S^{2}}{\sf N}(P_{1}){\sf N}(P_{2}){\sf N}(P_{3})\,\frac{C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3})}{C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3})}$$ $$=C_{\rm S^{2}}{\sf N}(P_{1}){\sf N}(P_{2}){\sf N}(P_{3})\,$$

where we have used the relation between the structure constants of timelike and spacelike Liouville given in (3.6) together with reflection invariance of Cb. Here, CS2 reflects the arbitrary normalization of the string path integral.

We fix the arbitrary normalizations N(P) of the vertex operators by requiring that

${\rm V}_{0,3}^{(b)}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3})\stackrel{{!}}{{=}}1$, (3.21)

which implies that N(P) ≡ N is independent of P and

$C_{\rm S^{2}}={\rm N}^{-3}$.

### 3.2 Worldsheet boundary conditions

In order to discuss configurations with asymptotic boundaries we need to supplement the worldsheet CFT with conformal boundary conditions. Here we review the conformal boundary conditions of spacelike and timelike Liouville CFT, and describe their role in the worldsheet description of configurations with asymptotic boundaries in Virasoro minimal string theory. Throughout we emphasize the definition of the conformal boundary conditions in terms of abstract boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) data rather than in terms of specific boundary conditions for the Liouville fields in the Lagrangian descriptions of the theories.

#### Conformal boundary conditions for spacelike Liouville

Spacelike Liouville CFT admits two main types of conformal boundary conditions, whose properties we summarize in turn.

ZZ boundary conditions. The first are the ZZ boundary conditions [83], which are labelled by a degenerate representation of the Virasoro algebra. In defining conformal boundary conditions, it is convenient to map the upper half-plane to the unit disk by a conformal transformation so that the boundary condition defines a state in the Hilbert space of the CFT on the circle by the usual radial quantization. The ZZ boundary states can be represented in terms of the Ishibashi states |VP ⟩⟩ associated with the primaries in the spectrum as follows12

$${\rm ZZ}^{(b)}_{(m,n)}\rangle=\int_{0}^{\infty}\!{\rm d}P\,\rho^{(b)}_{0}(P)\Psi^{(b)}_{(m,n)}(P)|V_{P}\rangle\rangle.\tag{3.23}$$

The quantity Ψ(b) (m,n) (P), which we will specify shortly, is the disk one-point function of the primary VP in the presence of the (m, n) ZZ boundary condition.

Consider the annulus formed by cutting a circle of radius e−πt out of the unit disk, with Ishibashi states |VP1 ⟩⟩ and |VP2 ⟩⟩ on the inner and outer boundary circles respectively. This configuration corresponds by the usual exponential map to the following partition function on a cylinder with unit radius and length πt:

$$\langle\!\langle V_{P_{1}}|{\rm e}^{-\pi t(L_{0}+\bar{L}_{0}-\frac{\pi}{12})}|V_{P_{2}}\rangle\!\rangle=\frac{\delta(P_{1}-P_{2})+\delta(P_{1}+P_{2})}{\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P_{1})}\,\chi_{P_{1}}^{(b)}(it)\,\tag{3.24}$$

<sup>12</sup>The convention of including ρ (b) 0 (P) in the measure of the integral over P is natural in our normalization of Liouville theory. This will also lead to analytic expressions for the wave-functions, contrary to the perhaps more familiar conventions from the literature.

where

$$\chi^{(b)}_{P}(\tau)=\frac{q^{P^{2}}}{\eta(\tau)}\,\quad q={\rm e}^{2\pi{\rm i}\tau}\tag{3.25}$$

is the non-degenerate Virasoro character associated with a primary of conformal weight hP . The ZZ boundary states are defined by the property that the cylinder partition function with the (m, n) and (1, 1) boundary conditions assigned to the two ends is given by the corresponding Virasoro character in the open string channel [83]

$$\langle{\rm ZZ}^{(b)}_{(m,n)}|\,{\rm e}^{-\pi t(L_{0}+\hat{L}_{0}-\frac{\kappa}{2\pi})}\,|{\rm ZZ}^{(b)}_{(1,1)}\rangle=\int_{0}^{\infty}{\rm d}P\,\rho^{(b)}_{0}(P)\Psi^{(b)}_{(m,n)}(P)\Psi^{(b)}_{(1,1)}(P)\chi^{(b)}_{P}(it)\tag{3.26}$$ $$\stackrel{{!}}{{=}}\chi^{(b)}_{(m,n)}(\frac{i}{t})$$ $$={\rm Tr}\,_{{\cal H}_{(m,n)}(i,1)}{\rm e}^{-\frac{2\pi}{\hbar}(L_{0}-\frac{\kappa}{2\pi})}\,$$

with

$$\chi^{(b)}_{(m,n)}(\tau)=\frac{q^{-\frac{1}{4}(mb+nb^{-1})^{2}}-q^{-\frac{1}{4}(mb-nb^{-1})^{2}}}{\eta(\tau)}\,,\quad q=\mathrm{e}^{2\pi i\tau}\tag{3.27}$$

the torus character of the (m, n) degenerate representation of the Virasoro algebra. This fixes the bulk one-point functions to be

$$\Psi^{(b)}_{(m,n)}(P)=\frac{4\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi mbP)\sinh(2\pi nb^{-1}P)}{\rho^{(b)}_{0}(P)}.\tag{3.28}$$

In particular we have Ψ(b) (1,1)(P) = 1, for which the cylinder partition function is the Virasoro identity character in the open-string channel. In the last line of (3.26) we have reminded the reader that the cylinder partition function admits an interpretation in terms of a trace over the Hilbert space of the CFT on the strip with thermal circle of size 2π t . The more general cylinder partition function with mixed ZZ boundary conditions is given by the following sum over degenerate Virasoro characters in the open string channel [83]

$$\langle{\rm ZZ}^{(b)}_{(m,n)}|\,{\rm e}^{-\pi t(L_{0}+\bar{L}_{0}-\frac{c}{2\pi})}\,|{\rm ZZ}^{(b)}_{(m^{\prime},n^{\prime})}\rangle=\sum_{r^{2}|m-m^{\prime}|+1}^{m+m^{\prime}-1}\sum_{s^{2}|n-m^{\prime}|+1}^{n+m^{\prime}-1}\chi^{(b)}_{(r,s)}(\frac{i}{t})\,\tag{3.29}$$

where the notation 2= is meant to indicate that the variable increases in steps of 2.

FZZT boundary conditions. Spacelike Liouville theory also admits a distinct oneparameter family of conformal boundaries known as the FZZT boundary conditions [84,85]. It is described by the following boundary state

$${\rm FZZT}^{(b)}(s)\rangle=\int_{0}^{\infty}{\rm d}P\,\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)\Psi^{(b)}(s;P)|V_{P}\rangle\rangle.\tag{3.30}$$

The FZZT parameter s takes real values. Indeed we will see that it labels a state in the spectrum of Liouville theory. The FZZT boundary state is defined such that the Hilbert space of Liouville CFT on the strip with FZZT boundary conditions on one end and (1, 1) ZZ boundary conditions on the other is spanned by a single primary state labelled by the Liouville momentum s. Indeed, the mixed cylinder partition function is given by a single non-degenerate Virasoro character in the open-string channel

$$\langle{\rm ZZ}^{(b)}_{(1,1)}|{\rm e}^{-\pi t(L_{0}+L_{0}-\frac{c}{\hbar})}|{\rm FZZT}^{(b)}(s)\rangle=\int_{0}^{\infty}{\rm d}P\,\rho^{(b)}_{0}(P)\Psi^{(b)}_{(1,1)}(P)\Psi^{(b)}(s;P)\chi^{(b)}_{P}(it)\tag{3.31}$$ $$\stackrel{{!}}{{=}}\chi^{(b)}_{s}(\stackrel{{!}}{{t}})\.$$

Hence the FZZT bulk one-point function Ψ(b) (s; P) is given by

$$\Psi^{(b)}(s;P)=\frac{\mathbb{S}_{sP}[1]}{\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)}=\frac{2\sqrt{2}\cos(4\pi sP)}{\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)}.\tag{3.32}$$

Here S[1] is the crossing kernel for Virasoro characters on the torus.

In what follows the partition function of Liouville CFT on the cylinder with FZZT boundary conditions at the two ends will play an important role. It is given by

$$\langle{\rm FZZT}^{(b)}(s_{1})|{\rm e}^{-\pi{\rm i}(L_{0}+L_{0}-\frac{\epsilon}{12})}|{\rm FZZT}^{(b)}(s_{2})\rangle=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Gamma}{\rm d}P\,\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)\Psi^{(b)}(s_{1};P)\Psi^{(b)}(s_{2};P)\chi_{P}^{(b)}(it)\tag{3.33}$$ $$=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\int_{\Gamma}{\rm d}P\,\frac{\cos(4\pi s_{1}P)\cos(4\pi s_{2}P)}{\sinh(2\pi bP)\sinh(2\pi b-1P)}\,\chi_{P}^{(b)}(it)\.$$

Here we have promoted the integral over the positive P axis to a horizontal contour Γ in the complex P plane that avoids the pole of the integrand at the origin. Since the residue at P = 0 vanishes, it does not matter whether the contour passes above or below 0. The open string spectrum consists of a continuum of states with weights above the c−1 24 threshold.

#### Conformal boundary conditions for timelike Liouville

When we add boundaries to the worldsheet in Virasoro minimal string theory we will pair particular conformal boundaries for the spacelike Liouville sector with those of the timelike Liouville sector. Conformal boundary conditions for timelike Liouville CFT have been relatively unexplored compared to their spacelike counterparts (see however [86]). Here we will introduce a new family of ZZ-like boundary conditions for timelike Liouville CFT that will play a distinguished role in the Virasoro minimal string. Before moving on, let us emphasize that conformal boundaries of non-unitary and non-compact CFTs are relatively weakly constrained13 and thus it is a priori not particularly clear what wavefunctions should be allowed. Nevertheless, we find the following boundary condition very natural.

"Half-ZZ" boundary conditions. Consider the following boundary states for timelike Liouville CFT

$$\widehat{\cal Z}^{(i\bar{b})}_{(m,\pm)}\rangle=\int_{\cal C}{\rm d}\widehat{P}\,\frac{(i\bar{P})^{2}}{2\rho_{0}^{(\bar{b})}(i\widehat{P})}\widehat{\Psi}^{(i\bar{b})}_{(m,\pm)}(\widehat{P})|\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}}\rangle\rangle\,\tag{3.34}$$

where |Vb Pb⟩⟩ is the Ishibashi state associated to the primary Vb Pb in the spectrum of timelike Liouville CFT, normalized such that

$$\langle\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{1}}|e^{-\pi t(L_{0}+L_{0}-\frac{i}{\hbar^{2}})}|\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{2}}\rangle\rangle=\frac{2\rho_{0}^{(\widehat{b})}(i\widehat{P})}{(i\widehat{P})^{2}}\left(\delta(\widehat{P}_{1}-\widehat{P}_{2})+\delta(\widehat{P}_{1}+\widehat{P}_{2})\right)\chi_{p}^{(\widehat{b})}(it).\tag{3.35}$$

In (3.34) we have again included the measure that descends from the two-point function of timelike Liouville CFT (see e.g. (3.8)), which is natural in our normalization. The contour is also the same as appears in section 3.1 and that avoids all the poles on the real line, C = R + iε. The corresponding conformal boundary conditions come in two infinite families, labelled by a positive integer m ∈ Z≥1 and a sign. We declare that the bulk one-point functions on the disk Ψb(iˆb) (m,±) are given by14

$$\widehat{\Psi}^{(i\hat{b})}_{(m,\pm)}(\widehat{P})=\frac{4\sin(2\pi m\hat{b}^{\pm1}\widehat{P})}{\widehat{P}}.\tag{3.36}$$

In what follows we will refer to these as "half-ZZ" boundary conditions. The reason for the "half-ZZ" name is that the product of the (m, +) and (n, −) wavefunctions (3.36) is functionally similar (but not identical) to that of the (m, n) ordinary ZZ boundary conditions (3.28) adapted to timelike Liouville CFT with ˆc ≤ 1.

In order to assess these boundary states, we scrutinize the cylinder partition functions associated with them. In particular, consider the cylinder partition function with (m, +)

<sup>13</sup>Here we mean that in non-compact and non-unitary CFT, in implementing the cylinder bootstrap the spectrum in the open-string channel is a priori not subject to the usual constraints of positivity, discreteness, and integrality. Nevertheless we will see that the cylinder partition functions involving the conformal boundary conditions that we will introduce obey these properties.

<sup>14</sup>Here the ± on the RHS is correlated to that on the LHS; it does not mean the product of the expressions with each sign, as was the case in (3.1).

half-ZZ boundary conditions on one end and (n, +) on the other. It is given by

Z (iˆb) (m,+;n,+)(t) = ⟨ZZc(iˆb) (m,+)|e −πt(L0+L¯0− cˆ 12 ) |ZZc(iˆb) (n,+)⟩ = Z C dPb (iPb) 2 2ρ (ˆb) 0 (iPb) Z C dPb′ (iPb′ ) 2 2ρ (ˆb) 0 (iPb′ ) Ψb(iˆb) (m,+)(Pb)Ψb(iˆb) (n,+)(Pb′ )⟨⟨Vb Pb|e −πt(L0+L¯0− cˆ 12 ) |Vb Pb′⟩⟩ = Z C dPb (iPb) 2 2ρ (ˆb) 0 (iPb) Ψb(iˆb) (m,+)(Pb)Ψb(iˆb) (n,+)(Pb)χ (iˆb) Pb (it) = mX +n−1 r 2=|m−n|+1 X∞ s 2=1 χ (iˆb) (r,s) ( i t ) . (3.37)

The result takes the form of an infinite sum over degenerate characters of the central charge cˆ Virasoro algebra in the open-string channel. The structure of degenerate representations of the ˆc ≤ 1 Virasoro algebra is such that this sum is actually convergent. Indeed, the cylinder partition function (3.37) is formally equivalent to that of spacelike Liouville CFT with (m, ∞) and (n, ∞) ordinary ZZ boundary conditions analytically continued to ˆc ≤ 1.15 Analogously, we have

$$Z^{(ib)}_{(m,-;n,-)}(t)=\sum_{r\stackrel{{\mbox{\scriptsize$\geq$}}}{{=}}1}^{\infty}\sum_{s\stackrel{{\mbox{\scriptsize$\geq$}}}{{=}}|m-n|+1}^{m+n-1}\chi^{(ib)}_{(r,s)}(\frac{i}{t}).\tag{3.38}$$

A very similar calculation yields the following for the cylinder partition function in timelike Liouville theory with (m, +) and (n, −) half-ZZ boundary conditions

$$Z^{(ib)}_{(m_{i}+n_{i},-)}(t)=\langle\widetilde{Z}\widetilde{Z}^{(ib)}_{(m_{i}+)}|{\rm e}^{-\pi t(L_{0}+L_{0}-\frac{t}{12})}|\widetilde{Z}\widetilde{Z}^{(ib)}_{(n_{i}-)}\rangle=\sum_{\begin{subarray}{c}r_{-2}^{2}-m+1\end{subarray}}^{m-1}\sum_{s_{-}^{2}-n+1}^{n-1}\chi^{(ib)}_{\widetilde{P}=\frac{1}{2}(rb-\delta^{-1})}(\frac{t}{t}).\tag{3.39}$$

The result involves a finite sum over certain non-degenerate Virasoro characters in the openstring channel (some of which involve conformal weights equal to those of particular degenerate representations of the Virasoro algebra).

Timelike Liouville CFT presumably also admits a suitable generalization of the FZZT boundary conditions [86], which are conceptually similar to those of spacelike Liouville theory that were discussed in section 3.2. In this paper we will not make use of FZZT boundary conditions for timelike Liouville CFT and so we will not discuss them any further here.

<sup>15</sup>However for spacelike Liouville theory, the sum over degenerate characters would diverge.

## 4 A three-dimensional perspective

In this section, we give a conceptual derivation of the proposed duality. Our arguments will heavily involve a connection to a chiral half of three-dimensional gravity on the topology Σg,n × S 1 .

#### 4.1 3d gravity on Σg,n × S 1

We consider three-dimensional quantum gravity with negative cosmological constant. Let Σg,n be an initial-value surface of genus g with n punctures. Then it is known that the Hilbert space of 3d gravity on Σg,n can be identified with Hgravity = Hg,n ⊗ Hg,n, where Hg,n is the space of Virasoro conformal blocks with all internal conformal weights above the c−1 24 threshold [87, 88]. Since these are precisely the conformal blocks that appear in Liouville theory, we will often adopt "Liouville conformal blocks" as a shorthand. The central charge of the Liouville theory is given by the Brown-Henneaux central charge c, which is an arbitrary parameter of the theory. As in the rest of the paper, we take c ≥ 25. Insertions of vertex operators on Σg,n correspond to massive particles in the three-dimensional picture (for conformal weights h ≤ c−1 24 ) and to black holes (for conformal weight h > c−1 24 ).

In ordinary 3d gravity, we take the central charge of the two factors Hg,n to be equal, but we can also consider the case where the right-moving central charge ¯c is different. In particular, the relation to 2d gravity will appear in a chiral version of gravity, where ¯c = 0. In this case, we can remove one factor of the Hilbert space and simply take a chiral half

${\cal H}_{g,n}=$ space of Liouville conformal blocks . (4.1)

We can endow this space with an inner product to turn it into a Hilbert space. Letting F1 and F2 be two Liouville conformal blocks, we have schematically [87, 88]

$$\langle{\cal F}_{1}\,|\,{\cal F}_{2}\rangle=\int_{{\cal T}_{g,n}}\,\overline{{\cal F}}_{1}\,{\cal F}_{2}\,Z_{\rm tL}\,Z_{\rm gh}\,\,,\tag{4.2}$$

where ZtL is the partition function of timelike Liouville theory of central charge 26−c. Zgh is the bc-ghost partition function as in string theory that provides the measure to integrate over Teichm¨uller space Tg,n. Let us recall that Teichm¨uller space is the universal covering space of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces Mg,n. Since the conformal blocks are not crossing symmetric it would not make sense to restrict this integral to moduli space. However, just like in string theory, the total central charge needs to equal 26 for the Weyl anomaly to cancel. In the presence of punctures ZtL should be thought of as a correlation function in timelike Liouville theory, where the vertex operators are chosen such that all the combined external conformal weights sum to one.

Only Liouville conformal blocks are (delta-function) normalizable with respect to this inner product. In fact, there is an explicit formula for this inner product [88]. For the four-punctured sphere, it takes the following form16

$$\langle{\cal F}^{(b)}_{0,4}({\bf P}^{\rm ext};P)\,|\,{\cal F}^{(b)}_{0,4}({\bf P}^{\rm ext};P^{\prime})\rangle=\frac{\rho^{(b)}_{0}(P)^{-1}\,\delta(P-P^{\prime})}{C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},P)C_{b}(P_{3},P_{4},P)}\,\tag{4.3}$$

where we assumed the two conformal blocks to be in the same OPE channel. We also wrote Pext = (P1, P2, P3, P4). Here and throughout we use the notation | F(b) g,n(Pext; P)⟩ for the states in Hg,n whose wavefunction at some fixed value of the moduli m is given by F (b) g,n(Pext; P|m). More generally, we get a factor of Cb(Pj , Pk, Pl) −1 for every threepunctured sphere appearing in the pair-of-pants decomposition of the conformal block and a factor of ρ (b) 0 (P) −1 for every cuff. This is precisely the inverse of the OPE density of spacelike Liouville theory, for which we summarized our conventions in section 3.1 and appendix C. This formula can be derived in a variety of ways [88]. It is for example fully fixed up to overall normalization by requiring that crossing transformations on conformal blocks act unitarily.

The inner product (4.2) is tantalizingly close to the integral that we want to compute for the two-dimensional theory of gravity under consideration. In fact, it tells us about the integral over Teichm¨uller space of the worldsheet partition/correlation function before integrating over the internal Liouville momenta. Let us make this a bit more precise as follows. Recall that the moduli space of Riemann surfaces is the quotient of Teichm¨uller space by the mapping class group. For example, in the simplest case of a once-punctured torus, this mapping class group is simply given by the group of modular transformations Map(Σ1,1) = SL(2, Z). There is a subgroup of the mapping class group Map(Σg,n) generated by Dehn twists around the curves used to define the pair of pants decomposition. It is an abelian group Z 3g−3+n . The conformal blocks transform with a simple phase e2πihP under such a Dehn twist, where P denotes the Liouville momentum through the curve around which we perform the Dehn twist. In particular, this phase cancels once one combines the left- and right-movers. We consider the case of the four-punctured sphere for simplicity. Then we have the following integral identity (we suppress the ghosts in the notation)

$$\int_{{\cal T}_{0,4}/\mathbb{Z}}\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},P)C_{b}(P_{3},P_{4},P)\big{|}{\cal F}_{0,4}^{(b)}({\bf P}^{\rm ext};P|z)\big{|}^{2}\left\langle\prod_{j=1}^{4}\widehat{V}_{iP_{j}}(z_{j})\right\rangle=2P.\tag{4.4}$$

This equation follows from eq. (4.3) as follows. Consider P close to P ′ . Then we can write

<sup>16</sup>This formula implicitly sets a convention for the normalization of the ghost partition function.

the integral over Teichm¨uller space that defines the inner product (4.2) as follows:

ρ (b) 0 (P) −1 δ(P − P ′ ) Cb(P1, P2, P)Cb(P3, P4, P) = X n∈Z e 2πin(hP −hP ′ ) Z T0,4/Z F (b) 0,4 (Pext; P|z) F (b) 0,4 (P ext; P ′ |z) Y 4 j=1 VbiPj (zj ) = δ(hP − hP′) Z T0,4/Z F (b) 0,4 (Pext; P|z) F (b) 0,4 (P ext; P ′ |z) Y 4 j=1 VbiPj (zj ) . (4.5)

In the first line, we chopped up the integral over Teichm¨uller space. We made some arbitrary choice of fundamental domain in the integration over T0,4/Z and used that the conformal blocks transform simply under Dehn twists. We can now strip off the delta-function and compare the coefficients. Since hP = c−1 24 + P 2 , we have (recall that we assume P, P′ ≥ 0):

$$\delta(h_{P}-h_{P^{\prime}})=\delta(P^{2}-(P^{\prime})^{2})=\frac{1}{2P}\delta(P-P^{\prime}).\tag{4.6}$$

Thus (4.4) follows.

Coming back to the chiral half of 3d gravity, the partition function on a 3-manifold of the form Σg,n × S 1 can be formally obtained as follows

ZΣg,n×S1 = 1 |Map(Σg,n)| dim Hg,n = 1 |Map(Σg,n)| Z d 3g−3+nP tr |F(b) g,n(Pext; P)⟩⟨F(b) g,n(Pext; P)| ⟨F(b) g,n(Pext; P)| F(b) g,n(Pext; P)⟩ = 1 |Map(Σg,n)| Z d 3g−3+nP Y a ρ (b) 0 (Pa) Y (j,k,l) Cb(Pj , Pk, Pl) × Z Tg,n  F (b) g,n(P ext; P|m)   2 Yn j=1 VbiPj (zj ) g Zgh = 1 |Map(Σg,n)| Z Tg,n Yn j=1 VPj (zj ) g Yn j=1 VbiPj (zj ) g Zgh = Z Mg,n Yn j=1 VPj (zj ) g Yn j=1 VbiPj (zj ) g Zgh = V (b) g,n(P1, . . . , Pn) . (4.7)

Here we used that the mapping class group Map(Σg,n) is gauged in gravity and that the three-dimensional mapping class group on Σg,n × S 1 coincides with the two-dimensional one. We have by definition Mg,n = Tg,n/Map(Σg,n). We also used that the Hamiltonian of gravity vanishes and the partition function before dividing by the mapping class group is simply given by the (infinite) dimension of the Hilbert space. We wrote this dimension as a trace of the identity, which we in turn wrote by inserting a complete set of conformal blocks, for which we used a braket notation to emphasize that they span the Hilbert space. By the inner product ⟨F(b) g,n|F(b) g,n⟩ in the second line of (4.7), we mean the coefficient of the delta-function appearing in (4.3). We then use the formula in terms of an integral over Teichm¨uller space (4.2) in the numerator and the explicit formula (4.3) in the denominator. We recognize the conformal block expansion of the spacelike Liouville correlation function in the third line of the above equation (4.7). Finally, we can gauge the mapping class group by using the crossing symmetry of the spacelike Liouville correlation function and restrict the integral to moduli space Mg,n. We thus reach the conclusion that the 2d gravity partition functions that we want to study are nothing else but the partition functions of chiral gravity on Σg,n × S 1 . Punctures in the 2d theory become Wilson lines in the 3d gravity theory that wrap the thermal circle.

Some comments are in order. First, the reader may worry that this derivation was a bit formal, since both the integral over Teichm¨uller space diverges and Map(Σg,n) is an infinite group. There are however several ways to get around this. For example, the inner product (4.2) can be derived from the path integral of 3d gravity, see [87]. Gauging of Map(Σg,n) in that path integral indeed reduces the integral to the quotient Mg,n = Tg,n/Map(Σg,n). Thus we could have gauged Map(Σg,n) from the very beginning and the gravity path integral can be brought to the form (4.7), thus circumventing the formal step in our argument. One can also compute equivariantly with respect to Map(Σg,n). The Hilbert space carries an action of the mapping class group that acts by crossing and while there are infinitely many conformal blocks, one can decompose the Hilbert space into irreducible representations of Map(Σg,n) and every irreducible representation appears only finitely many times. This removes the formal infinities appearing in the problem.

Second, the partition function appearing in (4.7) has no reason to be a positive integer. This is perhaps confusing since we would have expected that the gravity partition function would count the number of states of the Hilbert space obtained after dividing by Map(Σg,n). Such a chiral gravity theory can indeed be defined. However it differs in a rather subtle way from what we discuss here. To define it, one starts from a compactified phase space Mg,n, but the theory explicitly depends on the chosen compactification. Consistency then requires that the framing anomalies of the theory cancel, which imposes c ∈ 24Z and h ∈ Z. Moreover, since Mg,n has orbifold singularities, one needs to include contributions from twisted sectors. Such a theory is discussed in [89]. However, since we do not insist on a fully three-dimensional interpretation, we do not have to worry that these partition functions are non integer-valued.

### 4.2 Quantization and index theorem

We will now discuss an alternative way to compute the chiral gravity partition function on Σg,n × S 1 , which will make contact with the intersection theory on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. This discussion follows closely [89,90]. Let us again start with the phase space of gravity, which is given by Tg,n (or Mg,n if we want to divide by Map(Σg,n) before quantization). The symplectic form on Tg,n is the Weil-Petersson form c 48π2 ωWP(ℓ1, . . . , ℓn). In the case that punctures are present, the external conformal weights hj are related to the lengths of the geodesic boundaries of the Weil-Petersson form as follows:

$$h_{j}=\frac{c}{24}\left(1+\frac{\ell_{j}^{2}}{4\pi^{2}}\right).\tag{4.8}$$

To pass to the quantum theory, we want to quantize this phase space. Since Teichm¨uller space is a K¨ahler manifold, a convenient way of doing so is to use K¨ahler quantization. The result is that the wavefunctions are holomorphic sections of a line bundle L over Teichm¨uller space whose curvature is

$$c_{1}({\cal L})=\frac{c}{48\pi^{2}}\,\omega_{\rm WP}(\ell_{1},\ldots,\ell_{n}).\tag{4.9}$$

Holomorphic sections of this line bundle can be identified with Liouville conformal blocks which lead to the description of the Hilbert space discussed above. The non-triviality of the line bundle is an expression of the conformal anomaly, since conformal blocks are not functions of the moduli; this is only true after fixing an explicit metric, i.e. trivialization of the bundle. Of course, Tg,n is a contractible space and thus we could trivialize this line bundle (in a non-canonical way). However, this will not be true once we restrict to moduli space and thus it is important to keep the curvature at this point.

We can then compute the partition function of chiral gravity on Σg,n×S 1 by counting the number of holomorphic sections of this line bundle. It can be computed from the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch index theorem:

$$\dim{\cal H}_{g,n}=\int_{{\cal T}_{g,n}}{\rm td}({\cal T}_{g,n})\,{\rm e}^{\frac{G}{48\pi^{2}}\omega_{\rm WP}(\ell_{1},...,\ell_{n})}.\tag{4.10}$$

Here, td denotes the Todd class of the tangent bundle. Thus the partition function of 3d gravity may be computed by restricting this divergent integral to moduli space:

$$Z_{\Sigma_{g,n}\times{\rm S}^{1}}=\int_{{\cal M}_{g,n}}{\rm td}({\cal M}_{g,n})\,{\rm e}^{\frac{c}{48\pi^{2}}\omega_{\rm WP}(\ell_{1},...,\ell_{n})}.\tag{4.11}$$

We used that the tangent bundle of moduli space has the same curvature as the tangent bundle of Teichm¨uller space and thus the characteristic classes agree. We can then extend the integral to Mg,n and treat the integrand as cohomology classes. Using that the cohomology class of the Weil-Petersson form is given by (A.6) and the relation of the lengths and conformal weights (4.8), we arrive at eq. (2.20).

This computation contains the same formal infinities as before. However, this is again not a problem. We could have used an equivariant version of the index theorem to render the expressions well-defined. We also remark that the proof of the index theorem via the heat kernel is a local computation which is unaffected by the compactness of the manifold.

Thus, we arrive at a central claim of the paper, namely

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})=\int_{{\cal M}_{g,n}}{\rm td}({\cal M}_{g,n})\,{\rm e}^{\frac{c}{24}\kappa_{1}+\sum_{j=1}^{n}(P_{j}^{2}-\frac{1}{24})\psi_{j}}\,\,\,.\tag{4.12}$$

We recall the definition of the ψ- and κ-classes for the benefit of the reader in appendix A. We also extended the integral to the Deligne-Mumford compactification of Mg,n in order to use the standard intersection theory on moduli space.

We can then use the following formula for the Todd class of the tangent bundle:

$${\rm td}({\cal M}_{g,n})=\exp\left(-\frac{13}{24}\kappa_{1}+\frac{1}{24}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\psi_{j}-\sum_{m\geq1}\frac{B_{2m}}{(2m)(2m)!}\kappa_{2m}\right)\,,\tag{4.13}$$

where B2m are the Bernoulli numbers. This formula was derived in [89] for the tangent bundle of Mg,n. The two formulas differ slightly, because the treatment of the boundary divisor is different. It is clear that the formula of interest should not get contributions from boundary divisors since it is obtained by restricting an integrand on Tg,n. To derive this formula, one applies the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem to the forgetful map Mg,n+1 −→ Mg,n and the line bundle of quadratic differentials on the Riemann surface, which in turn span the cotangent space of Mg,n. This application is standard in algebraic geometry, see e.g. [91] for a general context. We thus obtain

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})=\int_{\overline{\cal M}_{g,n}}\exp\left(\frac{c-13}{24}\kappa_{1}+\sum_{j=1}^{n}P_{j}^{2}\psi_{j}-\sum_{m\geq1}\frac{B_{2m}}{(2m)(2m)!}\,\kappa_{2m}\right).\tag{4.14}$$

This reproduces eq. (2.20). Similar generalizations of the Weil-Petersson volumes from an intersection point of view were considered for example in [92]. This establishes the links between the worldsheet formulation, 3d gravity and the intersection theory on Mg,n as depicted in figure 1.

### 4.3 Dilaton and string equation

Fully analyzing (4.14) requires fairly deep mathematics in the form of topological recursion, which we will discuss in section 5.3. However, it is more straightforward to deduce two simpler equations for the quantum volumes directly. Borrowing terminology from topological gravity, we call them the dilaton and the string equation. We already wrote them down without further explanation in eqs. (2.21a) and (2.21b) and repeat them here

V (b) g,n+1(P = iQb 2 , P) − V (b) g,n+1(P = iQ 2 , P) = (2g − 2 + n)V (b) g,n(P) , (4.15a)

$$\int_{\frac{l_{0}^{2}}{2}}^{\frac{l_{0}^{2}}{2}}2P\,{\rm d}P\;{\sf V}_{g,n+1}^{(b)}(P,{\bf P})=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\int_{0}^{P_{j}}2P_{j}\,{\rm d}P_{j}\;{\sf V}_{g,n}^{(b)}({\bf P})\;.\tag{4.15b}$$

The reason for the existence of these equations is that one can integrate out the location of the (n+1)-st marked point of the integrand on the LHS. In the language of the cohomology of the moduli space, this is implemented by the pushforward in cohomology. Let

$$\pi:\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n+1}\longrightarrow\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}\tag{4.16}$$

be the map between moduli spaces that forgets the location of the (n + 1)-st marked point. Then integrating over its location is given by the pushforward

$$\pi_{*}:{\rm H}^{\bullet}({\cal M}_{g,n+1},{\mathbb{C}})\longrightarrow{\rm H}^{\bullet-2}({\cal M}_{g,n},{\mathbb{C}}).\tag{4.17}$$

In appendix D, we show that the integrands of the dilaton and string equation (4.15a) and (4.15b) are simple to pushforward and the result can again be expressed in terms of the cohomology classes of the integrand for the quantum volumes. Integrating over Mg,n then gives the two equations. We refer the reader to appendix D for details.

### 4.4 Disk and trumpet partition functions

The 3d gravity point of view is very useful to understand the meaning of asymptotic boundaries, since an asymptotically (nearly) AdS2 boundary uplifts simply to an asymptotically AdS3 boundary.

The simplest topology with an asymptotic boundary is the disk D2 , for which the corresponding 3d topology is a solid cylinder. From the point of view of chiral gravity, it is thus clear that ZD2×S1 evaluates to the vacuum Virasoro character of the boundary torus, see e.g. [93]. The vacuum Virasoro character depends on the thermal length β˜ of S1 . It is related by a modular transformation to the boundary circle of the disk, which plays the role of time in the dual matrix model of our two-dimensional gravity theory. We thus set β = 4π 2 β˜ . This recovers (2.16a). A similar argument determines the trumpet partition function (2.16b).

They can also directly be derived from the integral (4.12) over moduli space. The relevant moduli space for the disk is the Virasoro coadjoint orbit Diff(S1 )/PSL(2, R), where PSL(2, R) corresponds to the three reparametrization modes of the disk. Quantization of the phase space Diff(S1 )/PSL(2, R) is thus achieved by quantizing Virasoro coadjoint orbits which leads again to Virasoro characters [94]. Finally, the integral (4.12) over Diff(S1 )/PSL(2, R) can also be performed equivariantly, where β enters as an equivariant parameter. One can then use equivariant localization to compute it directly. We refer to [89, 95] for details on this. Similarly the trumpet partition function is obtained by the quantization of a generic Virasoro coadjoint orbit Diff(S1 )/S 1 .

It now also follows that one can glue the trumpet partition function to the bulk part of the two-dimensional geometry as in JT gravity. We already determined the correct gluing measure 2P dP in eq. (4.4). Indeed, when gluing a trumpet, the geodesic where we are gluing the trumpet is unique and is in particular preserved by any mapping class group transformation. Thus the only mapping class group transformation interacting non-trivially with the trumpets are Dehn twists along the gluing geodesic and hence taking the Z quotient as in (4.4) reduces the integral over Teichm¨uller space to an integral over moduli space. Of course there can be still non-trivial mapping class group transformations acting only on the bulk part of the surface, but they do not interact with the gluing of trumpets. Hence (4.4) tells us that before integrating over P we get a factor of 2P, so that the total gluing measure is 2P dP. Thus (2.18) follows.

### 4.5 Further properties of the quantum volumes

Contrary to the worldsheet definition, the intersection theory approach gives manifestly analytic expressions for the quantum volumes V (b) g,n. The integral over Mg,n picks out the top form in the power series expansion of the integrand. Thus, it follows directly from (4.14) that the quantum volumes are polynomial in c and P 2 1 , . . . , P2 n with rational coefficients

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\in\mathbb{Q}[c,P_{1}^{2},\ldots,P_{n}^{2}].\tag{4.18}$$

The degree is 3g − 3 + n, which generalizes the well-known polynomial behaviour of the Weil-Petersson volumes [96].

This also makes it clear that eq. (4.14) exhibits the following unexpected duality symmetry:

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(iP_{1},\ldots,iP_{n})=(-1)^{3g-3+n}\,{\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n}).\tag{4.19}$$

Indeed, sending c → 26 − c and Pj → iPj acts on (4.14) by a minus sign on the coefficients of κ1 and ψj in the exponent. The other classes are in H4• (Mg,n) and thus we simply act by a minus sign on H4•+2(Mg,n). The integral picks out the top form on moduli space, which leads to the identification (4.19). In the presence of a boundary, it follows from (2.18) that the symmetry is modified to

$$Z^{(ib)}_{g,n}(\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{n})=i^{2g-2+n}Z^{(b)}_{g,n}(-\beta_{1},\ldots,-\beta_{n}).\tag{4.20}$$

Note however that because of the appearance of the square root in the trumpet partition function (2.16b), the symmetry extends to a Z4 symmetry.

From the worldsheet point of view, such a duality symmetry cannot even be defined, since the central charge of the timelike Liouville theory is constrained to ˆc ≤ 1 and thus only makes sense after analytically continuing the result for the quantum volumes in c and Pj . However, the presence of this symmetry means that timelike and spacelike Liouville theory are at least morally on democratic footing.

## 5 Virasoro matrix integral

In this section we study the dual matrix integral for the Virasoro minimal string. We start by collecting some important equations and results in the bigger scheme of random matrix theory, particularly Hermitian matrix integrals.

### 5.1 A brief review of matrix integrals

A Hermitian matrix integral is an integral of the form

$${\cal M}_{N}=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{N2}}[{\rm d}H]\,{\rm e}^{-N\,{\rm tr}\,V(H)}\,\tag{5.1}$$

where H is a Hermitian N × N matrix and V (H) is a polynomial in H. Matrix integrals of the form (5.1) are solvable in the large N limit [97–102] (for reviews see [35, 103, 104]) and FN ≡ − log(MN ) admits a perturbative expansion in powers of 1/N. Using a saddle point approximation we can obtain the leading contribution (of order N2 ) and using e.g. orthogonal polynomials, loop equations and topological recursion we get higher-order contributions [105– 107]. Of particular interest is the so called double scaling limit. In this limit the full genus expansion can be reduced to solving a differential equation [32–34, 108].

Every Hermitian matrix can be diagonalized using a unitary matrix U such that H = UDHU † with DH ≡ diag(λ1, . . . , λN ) a real diagonal matrix. The trace is invariant under this diagonalisation, but the measure in (5.1) picks up a non-trivial Jacobian: this Jacobian is known as the Vandermonde determinant ∆N (λ) ≡ Q i̸=j |λi − λj |. Explicitly we have

$${\cal M}_{N}=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}\prod_{i=1}^{N}{\rm d}\lambda_{i}\,{\rm e}^{-N^{2}S[\lambda]}\,\quad S[\lambda]=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}V(\lambda_{i})-\frac{1}{N^{2}}\sum_{i\neq j}\log|\lambda_{i}-\lambda_{j}|.\tag{5.2}$$

Note the reduction from N2 to N degrees of freedom. The saddle point equations for (5.2) are

$$V^{\prime}(\lambda_{i})=\frac{2}{N}\sum_{j\neq i}\frac{1}{\lambda_{i}-\lambda_{j}}.\tag{5.3}$$

To solve this equation we introduce the normalized eigenvalue density

$$\varrho(\lambda)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\delta(\lambda-\lambda_{i})\,\qquad\quad\int_{a_{-}}^{a_{+}}{\rm d}\lambda\,\varrho(\lambda)=1\,\tag{5.4}$$

where we assume that all eigenvalues are located within the strip [a−, a+] on the real axis. Additionally we introduce the resolvent

$$R_{N}(E)\equiv\frac{1}{N}\,{\rm Tr}\,(E\,{\mathds{1}}_{N}-H)^{-1}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{1}{E-\lambda_{i}}\,\qquad E\in{\mathbb{C}}\setminus\{\lambda_{i}\}.\tag{5.5}$$

Sending N → ∞ the sum can be replaced by an integral where each eigenvalue is weighted by its average density

$$\lim_{N\to\infty}R_{N}(E)\equiv R(E)=\int_{a_{-}}^{a_{+}}{\rm d}\mu\,\frac{\varrho(\mu)}{E-\mu}\,\tag{5.6}$$

where we assume that the eigenvalue distribution is connected and has compact support on a single real interval [a−, a+]. The resolvent relates to the eigenvalue density and the matrix potential through the following relations

$$\varrho(E)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\left(R(E-i\varepsilon)-R(E+i\varepsilon)\right),\quad E\in\mbox{supp}(\varrho)\,\tag{5.7a}$$

$V^{\prime}(E)=R(E+i\varepsilon)+R(E-i\varepsilon)\,\quad E\in{\rm supp}(\varrho)\,$ (5.7b)

where ε is a small positive number and we used the large N limit of (5.3) to obtain (5.7b). Additionally it satisfies limE→∞ ER(E) = 1 which immediately follows from the definition (5.6).

In the next subsection we discuss methods to obtain correlation functions of the resolvents. These satisfy an expansion of the form

$$\langle R(E_{1})\ldots R(E_{n})\rangle_{\rm com.}\approx\sum_{g=0}^{\infty}\frac{R_{g,n}(E_{1},E_{2},\ldots,E_{n})}{N^{2g-2+n}}.\tag{5.8}$$

On the right hand side the power of N accounts for the genus and the number of boundaries. The resolvent (5.6) is equal to R0,1(E1) in this expansion. Without providing details since they can be found in multiple recent papers (see e.g. in [36, 109]) we also have

$$R_{0,2}(E_{1},E_{2})=\frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{\sqrt{-E_{1}}\sqrt{-E_{2}}(\sqrt{-E_{1}}+\sqrt{-E_{2}})^{2}}.\tag{5.9}$$

This result is universal for matrix integrals with support on a single interval.

### 5.2 Density of states and resolvent

In the double scaling limit we take the limit N → ∞ and zoom into one edge of the eigenvalue distribution. In this limit the perturbative eigenvalue distribution is supported on the entire real positive axis and becomes non-normalizable. The double-scaled matrix integral is perturbatively completely fixed by this density of eigenvalues. Upon double scaling the eigenvalue density is given by [36]

$$\varrho_{0}^{\rm total}(E)={\rm e}^{S_{0}}\,\varrho_{0}^{(b)}(E)\,\tag{5.10}$$

and hence eS0 is a rough analogue of N and plays the role of the parameter that controls the perturbative genus expansion. For example, (5.8) still holds after double scaling but with N replaced by eS0 . In the Virasoro matrix integral,

$$\varrho_{0}^{(b)}(E)\,{\rm d}E=\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)\,{\rm d}P=4\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi bP)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}P)\,{\rm d}P\,\tag{5.11}$$

where E = P 2 = hP − c−1 24 is the energy in the matrix model. For b → 0, one of the sinh's linearizes and we recover the famous sinh(√ E) dE density of states of JT gravity [36]. As already stressed in section 2.3, this is the universal Cardy density of states that endows the Virasoro matrix integral with its name.

One way to obtain ϱ (b) 0 (E) is through the inverse Laplace transform of the disk partition function (2.17a)

$$\varrho_{0}^{(b)}(E)=2\sqrt{2}\,\frac{\sinh(2\pi b\sqrt{E})\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}\sqrt{E})}{\sqrt{E}}=\int_{-i\infty+\gamma}^{i\infty+\gamma}\frac{\mathrm{d}\beta}{2\pi i}\,\mathrm{e}^{\beta E}Z_{\mathrm{disk}}^{(b)}(\beta)\,\tag{5.12}$$

where γ ∈ R+ is such that the contour is to the right of the singularities of Z (b) disk in the complex β plane.

Recall that the leading density of states ϱ (b) 0 may also be computed as the discontinuity of the genus-zero contribution to the resolvent, see equation (5.7a). For (g, n) ̸= (0, 1), all other resolvents may be obtained from the partition functions Z (b) g,n (which are in turn related to the quantum volumes by gluing trumpets as in (2.18)) by Laplace transform as

$$R^{(b)}_{g,n}(-z^{2}_{1},\ldots,-z^{2}_{n})=\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\prod_{j=1}^{n}{\rm d}\beta_{j}\,{\rm e}^{-\beta_{j}z^{2}_{j}}\right)Z^{(b)}_{g,n}(\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{n}).\tag{5.13}$$

Here we have written the energies Ei = −z 2 i as negative for convergence of the integrals, but may analytically continue to positive energies afterwards. Hence by combining eq. (2.18) and (5.13) the quantum volumes themselves may be obtained from the resolvents by inverse Laplace transform

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})=\int_{-i\infty+\gamma}^{i\infty+\gamma}\Big{(}\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{{\rm d}z_{j}}{2\pi{\rm i}}\,{\rm e}^{{\rm i}\pi P_{j}z_{j}}\,\frac{\sqrt{2}z_{j}}{P_{j}}\Big{)}R^{(b)}_{g,n}(-z_{1}^{2},\ldots,-z_{n}^{2})\,\tag{5.14}$$

for γ sufficiently large.

### 5.3 Topological recursion

We now define the spectral curve [36, 107] of the Virasoro matrix integral

$$y^{(b)}(z)=-2\sqrt{2}\pi\frac{\sin(2\pi bz)\sin(2\pi b^{-1}z)}{z}\,\tag{5.15}$$

where z 2 ≡ −E as before. We also define ω (b) 0,1 (z) ≡ 2zy(b) (z)dz. Adjusting our notation to [36] we introduce the following modified resolvents

$$\omega^{(b)}_{g,n}(z_{1},\ldots,z_{n})\equiv(-1)^{n}2^{n}z_{1}\ldots z_{n}R^{(b)}_{g,n}(-z_{1}^{2},\ldots,-z_{n}^{2}){\rm d}z_{1}\ldots{\rm d}z_{n}.\tag{5.16}$$

In particular using (5.16) it follows from (5.9)

$$\omega_{0,2}^{(b)}(z_{1},z_{2})=\frac{{\rm d}z_{1}{\rm d}z_{2}}{(z_{1}-z_{2})^{2}}\,\tag{5.17}$$

where a convenient branch choice was made. For 2g−2+n > 0 we obtain the ω (b) g,n(z1, . . . , zn) from the recursion

$$\omega^{(b)}_{g,n}(z_{1},z_{2},\ldots,z_{n})=\text{Res}_{z\to0}\Big{(}K^{(b)}(z_{1},z)\big{[}\omega^{(b)}_{g-1,n+1}(z,-z,z_{2},\ldots z_{n})\tag{5.18}$$ $$+\sum_{h=0}^{g}\sum_{\begin{subarray}{c}\underline{\Omega}:\underline{\mathcal{J}}=[z_{2},-z_{n}]\\ \{h,\underline{\mathcal{J}}\neq\{0,0\}\\ \{h,\mathcal{J}\}\neq\{g,0\}\end{subarray}}\omega^{(b)}_{h,1+|\underline{\mathcal{I}}|}(z,\mathcal{I})\omega^{(b)}_{g-h,1+|\mathcal{J}|}(-z,\mathcal{J})\big{]}\Big{)}\,$$

where the recursion kernel K(b) (z1, z) is given by

$$K^{(b)}(z_{1},z)\equiv\frac{\int_{-z}^{z}\omega_{0,2}^{(b)}(z_{1},-)}{4\omega_{0,1}^{(b)}(z)}=-\frac{1}{(z_{1}^{2}-z^{2})}\frac{z}{8\sqrt{2}\pi\sin(2\pi bz)\sin(2\pi b^{-1}z)}.\tag{5.19}$$

These are the loop equations of the double-scaled matrix integral in the language of topological recursion. It determines the resolvent correlators (5.8) completely from the initial data R0,1(E) ≡ R(E) (5.6). Let us list some of the ω (b) g,n:

$$\omega^{(b)}_{0,1}(z_{1})=-4\sqrt{2}\pi\sin(2\pi bz_{1})\sin(2\pi b^{-1}z_{1}){\rm d}z_{1}\,\tag{5.20a}$$

$$\omega^{(b)}_{0,2}(z_{1},z_{2})=\frac{{\rm d}z_{1}{\rm d}z_{2}}{(z_{1}-z_{2})^{2}}\,\tag{5.20b}$$

$$\omega^{(b)}_{0,3}(z_{1},z_{2},z_{3})=-\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{3}\times2\sqrt{2}}\frac{{\rm d}z_{1}{\rm d}z_{2}{\rm d}z_{3}}{z_{1}^{2}z_{2}^{2}z_{3}^{2}}\,\tag{5.20c}$$

$$\omega^{(b)}_{0,4}(z_{1},z_{2},z_{3},z_{4})=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{4}}\left(\frac{c-13}{96}+\frac{3}{8(2\pi)^{2}}\sum_{i=1}^{4}\frac{1}{z_{i}^{2}}\right)\frac{{\rm d}z_{1}{\rm d}z_{2}{\rm d}z_{3}{\rm d}z_{4}}{z_{1}^{2}z_{2}^{2}z_{3}^{2}z_{4}^{2}}\,\tag{5.20d}$$

ω (b) 1,1 (z1) = − 1 24π √ 2 c − 13 48 + 3 (4π) 2 1 z 2 1 dz1 z 2 1 , (5.20e)

$$\omega_{1,2}^{(b)}(z_{1},z_{2})=\frac{1}{(4\pi)^{6}}\bigg{[}\frac{3}{z_{1}^{2}z_{2}^{2}}+5\left(\frac{1}{z_{4}^{2}}+\frac{1}{z_{4}^{2}}\right)+\frac{2\pi^{2}}{3}(c-13)\left(\frac{1}{z_{1}^{2}}+\frac{1}{z_{2}^{2}}\right)\tag{5.20f}$$ $$+\frac{\pi^{4}}{18}(c-17)(c-9)\bigg{]}\frac{\mathrm{d}z_{1}\mathrm{d}z_{2}}{z_{1}^{2}z_{2}^{2}}\.$$

Let us explain how the topological recursion can be obtained from the definition of the quantum volumes in terms of integrals over the moduli space of curves Mg,n. This is a straightforward application of the result of [59]. [59, Theorem 3.3] states that for any choice of initial data ω (b) 0,1 , ω (b) g,n as computed from the topological recursion (5.18) is equal to the following intersection number of Mg,n:

$$\omega^{(b)}_{g,n}(z_{1},\ldots,z_{n})=2^{3g-3+n}\int_{\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}}\mathrm{e}^{\sum_{m}\tilde{t}_{m}\kappa_{m}}\prod_{j=1}^{n}\sum_{\ell\geq0}\frac{\Gamma(\ell+\frac{3}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{3}{2})}\frac{\psi^{\ell}_{j}\,\mathrm{d}z_{j}}{z_{j}^{2\ell+2}}.\tag{5.21}$$

The numbers t˜m are defined in terms of ω (b) 0,1 as follows. We expand ω (b) 0,1 (z) in (5.20a) for small z leading to

$$\omega^{(b)}_{0,1}(z)=\sum_{m\geq0}\frac{\Gamma(\frac{3}{2})t_{m}}{\Gamma(m+\frac{3}{2})}\,z^{2m+2}\,{\rm d}z.\tag{5.22}$$

The coefficients t˜m in (5.21) are then defined via the equality of the following power series in u

$$\sum_{m\geq0}t_{m}u^{m}=\exp\Big{(}-\sum_{m\geq0}\tilde{t}_{m}u^{m}\Big{)}.\tag{5.23}$$

In our case, it follows from (5.20) that

$$\tilde{t}_{0}=-\frac{3}{2}\log(8\pi^{2})+\pi i\,\tag{5.24a}$$

$$\hat{t}_{1}=\frac{c-13}{24}\,(2\pi)^{2}\,\tag{5.24b}$$

$$\tilde{t}_{2m}=-\frac{B_{2m}(2\pi)^{4m}}{(2m)(2m)!}\,\quad m\geq1.\tag{5.24c}$$

Using that κ0 = 2g − 2 + n, we thus obtain

ω (b) g,n(z1, . . . , zn)

= (2π) 6−6g−3n 2 − n 2 (−1)n Z Mg,n exp c − 13 24 (2π) 2κ1 − X m≥1 B2m(2π) 4m (2m)(2m)! κ2m X ℓ≥0 Γ(ℓ + 3 2 ) Γ( 3 2 ) ψ ℓ j dzj z 2ℓ+2 j = 2− 3n 2 (−π) −n Z Mg,n exp c − 13 24 κ1 − X m≥1 B2m κ2m (2m)(2m)!X ℓ≥0 Γ(ℓ + 3 2 ) Γ( 3 2 )(2π) 2ℓ ψ ℓ j dzj z 2ℓ+2 j = Z Y j (−4 √ 2πPjdPj e −4πzjPj ) Z Mg,n exp c − 13 24 κ1 − X m≥1 B2m κ2m (2m)(2m)!X ℓ≥0 P 2ℓ j ψ ℓ j dzj ℓ! = Z ∞ 0 Y j (−4 √ 2πPjdPj e −4πzjPj ) V (b) g,n(P1, . . . , Pn) dz1 . . . dzn , (5.25)

where we used the definition of the quantum volumes in terms of intersection numbers given in eq. (4.14). This formula is valid for Re zj > 0, but can be extended to any complex value of zj by analytic continuation.

For concreteness we can confirm the above relation (5.25) for the quantum volume V (b) 0,4 (2.19a) of the four punctured sphere and the quantum volume V (b) 1,1 (2.19b) of the once punctured disk. Using also the expressions for (5.20d) and (5.20e) we easily confirm

$$\omega_{0,4}^{(b)}(z_{1},z_{2},z_{3},z_{4})=\left[(-4\sqrt{2}\pi)^{4}\int_{0}^{\infty}\prod_{j=1}^{4}(P_{j}\mathrm{d}P_{j}\,\mathrm{e}^{-4\pi z_{j}P_{j}})\Big{(}\frac{c-13}{24}+\sum_{j=1}^{4}P_{j}^{2}\Big{)}\right]\mathrm{d}z_{1}\mathrm{d}z_{2}\mathrm{d}z_{3}\mathrm{d}z_{4}\tag{5.26a}$$ $$\omega_{1,1}^{(b)}(z_{1})=\left[(-4\sqrt{2}\pi)\int_{0}^{\infty}(P_{1}\mathrm{d}P_{1}\,\mathrm{e}^{-4\pi z_{1}P_{1}})\Big{(}\frac{c-13}{576}+\frac{1}{24}P_{1}^{2}\Big{)}\right]\mathrm{d}z_{1}\;.\tag{5.26b}$$

This provides the crucial link between intersection theory and the Virasoro matrix integral and hence the last missing arrow in figure 1. The same perturbative data can now be expressed in terms of the resolvents/differentials ω (b) g,n, the partition functions Z (b) g,n or the quantum volumes V (b) g,n. They carry all the same information and are related by simple integral transforms, which we summarize in figure 6. We have already seen most of the required relations in this triangle diagram. For completeness, let us also state the last two relations,

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})=\int_{\Gamma}\left(\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{{\rm d}\beta_{j}}{2\pi i}\,\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\beta_{j}}}\,\sigma_{j}^{\beta_{j}P_{j}^{2}}\right)Z^{(b)}_{g,n}(\frac{4\pi^{2}}{\beta_{1}},\ldots,\frac{4\pi^{2}}{\beta_{n}})\,\tag{5.27a}$$

$$Z^{(b)}_{g,n}(\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{n})=\int_{\Gamma}\left(\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{{\rm d}u_{j}}{2\pi i}\,e^{\beta_{j}u_{j}}\right)R^{(b)}_{g,n}(-u_{1},\ldots,-u_{n})\,\tag{5.27b}$$

where in both cases the integration contours Γ are vertical and to the right of all singularities of the relevant integrands.

![](_page_45_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 6: There are three quantities that all capture the same information that we discussed. They are all related by simple integral transformations, which we summarize here. We also recall that the differentials ω (b) g,n are just a more convenient way to write the resolvent; they are simply related via (5.16).

### 5.4 Deformed Mirzakhani recursion relation

We can translate the topological recursion (5.18) into a recursion relation for the quantum volumes V (b) g,n. For the original case of Mirzakhani's recursion, this was done for the Weil-Petersson volumes in [110], while various generalizations with supersymmetry were considered in [109]. Let us first note that since the differentials ω (b) g,n are polynomial in inverse powers of z −2 j , we can rewrite (5.14) as

$$\mathsf{V}^{(b)}_{\vartheta,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})=\int_{\Gamma}\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{i\,\mathrm{e}^{i\pi z_{j}P_{j}}}{2\sqrt{2\pi}P_{j}}\,\omega^{(b)}_{\vartheta,n}(z_{1},\ldots,z_{n})=\prod_{j=1}^{n}\operatorname*{Res}_{z_{j}=0}\frac{-\mathrm{e}^{i\pi z_{j}P_{j}}}{\sqrt{2}P_{j}}\omega^{(b)}_{\vartheta,n}(z_{1},\ldots,z_{n})\,\tag{5.28}$$

where again Γ is a contour that runs on the positively oriented shifted imaginary axis to the right of all singularities of the integrand. This representation is valid for Re Pj > 0, otherwise the result follows from analytic continuation. In the second representation, we used that zj = 0 is the only singularity of ω (b) g,n, provided that 3g − 3 + n ≥ 0.

Let us derive the first term in (2.13) from the topological recursion, all other terms are obtained by very similar computations. We can set n = 1, since all Pj 's in P are spectators. We have

P1V (b) g,1 (P1) = − 1 √ 2 Res z1=0 e 4πz1P1 ω (b) g,1 (z1) ⊃ − 1 √ 2 Res z1=0 e 4πz1P1 Res z=0 K(b) (z1, z) ω (b) g−1,2 (z, −z) = − 1 √ 2 Res z1=0 e 4πz1P1 Res z=0 K(b) (z1, z) ω (b) g−1,2 (z, z) = −4π 2 √ 2 Res z1=0 Res z=0 e 4πz1P1 K(b) (z1, z) × Z (2P dP)(2P ′ dP ′ ) e−4πz(P +P ′ )V (b) g−1,2 (P, P′ ) . (5.29)

We used that all the multi-differentials (except for ω (b) 0,2 ) are symmetric in zj . We can commute the two residues as follows:

Res Res = Res Res + Res Res $z_{1}$=0 $z$=0 $z$=0 $z_{1}$=$z$ =0 $z_{1}$=$-z$ (5.30)

since as a function of z1, the appearing function only has poles at z1 = z and z1 = −z. Using the explicit form of the recursion kernel (5.19) we can take the z1-residue, which leads to

$$P_{1}\mathsf{V}_{g,1}^{(b)}(P_{1})\supset\operatorname*{Res}_{z=0}\frac{\pi\sinh(4\pi P_{1}z)}{2\sin(2\pi bz)\sin(2\pi b^{-1}z)}\int(2P\,\mathrm{d}P)(2P^{\prime}\,\mathrm{d}P^{\prime})\,\mathrm{e}^{-4\pi z(P+P^{\prime})}\mathsf{V}_{g-1,2}^{(b)}(P,P^{\prime})$$ $$=\operatorname*{Res}_{t=0}\frac{\pi\sin(4\pi P_{1}t)}{2\sinh(2\pi bt)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}t)}\int(2P\,\mathrm{d}P)(2P^{\prime}\,\mathrm{d}P^{\prime})\,\mathrm{e}^{4\pi\mathrm{i}t(P+P^{\prime})}\mathsf{V}_{g-1,2}^{(b)}(P,P^{\prime})\,\tag{5.31}$$

where we set z = −it in the last equality. We can now rewrite the residue integral as a difference of two integrals as follows:

P1V (b) g,1 (P1) ⊃ Z R−iε − Z R+iε dt sin(4πP1t) 4isinh(2πbt) sinh(2πb−1 t) × Z (2P dP)(2P ′ dP ′ ) e4πit(P +P ′ )V (b) g−1,2 (P, P′ ) = Z R−iε dt sin(4πP1t) 4isinh(2πbt) sinh(2πb−1 t) Z (2P dP)(2P ′ dP ′ ) e−4πit(P +P ′ )V (b) g−1,2 (P, P′ ) − Z R+iε dt sin(4πP1t) 4isinh(2πbt) sinh(2πb−1 t) Z (2P dP)(2P ′ dP ′ ) e4πit(P +P ′ )V (b) g−1,2 (P, P′ ) . (5.32)

We used that the integral over P and P ′ is only absolutely convergent for Im t > 0 and is otherwise defined by analytic continuation. However, it is an even function in t and can thus be obtained by replacing t → −t for the contour R − iε. At this point all integrals are absolutely convergent and thus we can exchange the t-integral with the P and P ′ integral. This gives the desired form of Mirzakhani's recursion relation (2.13), with kernel

$$H(x,y)=\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^{-it}}\mathrm{d}t\,\frac{\sin(4\pi yt)\,\mathrm{e}^{-4\pi isit}}{4i\sinh(2\pi bt)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}t)}-\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^{+it}}\mathrm{d}t\,\frac{\sin(4\pi yt)\,\mathrm{e}^{4\pi isit}}{4i\sinh(2\pi bt)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}t)}.\tag{5.33}$$

This can be further massaged as follows to bring it to the form (2.14). Indeed, we can rewrite both integrals in terms of principal value integrals by picking up some part of the residue at t = 0. This gives

$$H(x,y)=\frac{y}{2}-\mbox{PV}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\!\!\mbox{d}t\,\frac{\sin(4\pi yt)(\mbox{e}^{4\pi ixt}-\mbox{e}^{-4\pi ixt})}{4i\sinh(2\pi bt)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}t)}\tag{5.34}$$ $$=\frac{y}{2}-\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\mbox{d}t\,\frac{\sin(4\pi xt)\sin(4\pi yt)}{\sinh(2\pi bt)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}t)}\,$$

which is the form given in eq. (2.14).

Let us also mention that for an efficient implementation of Mirzkhani's recursion relation, we have the following integral formulas:

$$\int_{0}^{\infty}(2x\,{\rm d}x)\ x^{2k}H(x,t)=F_{k}(t)\,\tag{5.35a}$$ $$=\int_{0}^{\infty}(2x\,{\rm d}x)\ x^{2k}H(x,t)=F_{k}(t)\,\tag{5.35b}$$

$$\int_{0}^{\infty}(2x\,{\rm d}x)\,(2y\,{\rm d}y)\,x^{2k}y^{2\ell}H(x+y,t)=\frac{2(2k+1)!(2\ell+1)!}{(2k+2\ell+3)!}\,F_{k+\ell+1}(t)\,\tag{5.35b}$$

where

$$F_{k}(t)=\mathop{\rm Res}_{u=0}\frac{(2k+1)!(-1)^{k+1}\sin(2tu)}{2^{2k+3}u^{2k+2}\sinh(bu)\sinh(b^{-1}u)}\tag{5.36}$$

$$=\sum_{0\leq\ell+m\leq k+1}\frac{(-1)^{\ell+m}(2k+1)!B_{2\ell}B_{2m}(1-2^{1-2\ell})(1-2^{1-2m})b^{2\ell-2m}t^{2k+3-2\ell-2m}}{(2\ell)!(2m)!(2k+3-2\ell-2m)!}.\tag{5.37}$$

We provide such an implementation in the ancillary Mathematica file.

# Part III Evidence and applications

## 6 Non-perturbative effects

In this section we discuss some of the non-perturbative effects of the Virasoro matrix integral. Our discussion follows the logic in [36] and we avoid adding too many details as they can be found therein. In particular [36, eq. 155] expresses the leading perturbative and leading non-perturbative behaviour of the density of eigenvalues. For the eigenvalue density (5.11) of the Virasoro minimal string we find

$$\langle\varrho^{(b)}(E)\rangle\approx\begin{cases}\mathrm{e}^{S_{0}}\varrho_{0}^{(b)}(E)-\frac{1}{4\pi E}\cos\left(2\pi\mathrm{e}^{S_{0}}\int_{0}^{E}\mathrm{d}E^{\prime}\varrho_{0}^{(b)}(E^{\prime})\right)\,&E>0\\ \frac{1}{-8\pi E}\exp\left(-V_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(b)}(E)\right)\,&E<0\,\end{cases}\tag{6.1}$$

where the effective potential V (b) eff is defined as

$$V^{(b)}_{\rm eff}(E)=2{\rm e}^{S_{0}}\int_{0}^{-E}{\rm d}x\,y^{(b)}(\sqrt{x})=2\sqrt{2}\,{\rm e}^{S_{0}}\left(\frac{\sin(2\pi\widehat{Q}\sqrt{-E}\,)}{\widehat{Q}}-\frac{\sin(2\pi Q\sqrt{-E}\,)}{Q}\right)\;,\tag{6.2}$$

with Q = b −1 + b and Qb = b −1 − b defined in section 2.2. The effective potential is the combination of the potential V (λ) (5.1) and the Vandermonde Jacobian (5.2). In figure 7 we see the oscillatory behaviour of the effective potential for some values of b. As in the JT case the term in the allowed region E is rapidly oscillating and larger than the first subleading perturbative contribution. On the other side we find a non-zero contribution in the classically forbidden regime E < 0. It accounts for the possibility of one eigenvalue sitting in the regime E < 0.

### 6.1 Non-perturbative corrections to the quantum volumes

The leading non-perturbative correction to the quantum volume V (b) n (S0; P1, . . . , Pn) is controlled by configurations of the matrix integral where one eigenvalue is in the classically forbidden region E < 0 and all the others are in the allowed region. Thus the leading non-perturbative correction is naturally given as an integral of the form

$$\int_{-\infty}^{0}{\rm d}E\ \langle\varrho^{(b)}(E)\rangle\ \ldots\tag{6.3}$$

![](_page_49_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 7: Plot of the effective potential V (b) eff (E) of the double-scaled Virasoro matrix integral in the region E < 0, shown for several values of the parameter b ̸= 1. Extrema of the effective potential occur at E∗ k,± = − k 2 b±2 4 .

for some operator insertions · · · depending on the quantity under consideration. In particular, for the quantum volumes, the operator insertions can be determined intuitively as follows. For a more rigorous derivation, we refer to [36, appendix A].

Let us start by discussing the leading non-perturbative correction to the resummed partition function

$$Z^{(b)}_{n}(S_{0};\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{n})\equiv\sum_{g=0}^{\infty}Z^{(b)}_{g,n}(\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{n})\,{\rm e}^{-(2g-2+n)S_{0}}.\tag{6.4}$$

Z (b) g,n(β1, . . . , βn) is obtained by inserting Qn j=1 tr (e−βjH) into the matrix integral. Focussing now on the single eigenvalue in the forbidden region, the insertions in (6.3) should be Qn j=1 e −βjE. We can then compute the corresponding insertions for the quantum volumes V (b) n by removing the trumpets, i.e. inverting (2.18). This basically amounts to an inverse Laplace transformation, see eq. (5.27a). However, in the process, we have to commute the integral over E with the integral of the inverse Laplace transform, which is not quite allowed. This makes the present derivation non-rigorous. Let us anyway go ahead. The inverse Laplace transform predicts the following operator insertion for the quantum volumes, assuming that the energy E < 0:

$$\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\gamma-i\infty}^{\gamma+i\infty}{\rm d}x\ {\rm e}^{P^{2}x}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{x}}\ {\rm e}^{-\frac{4\pi^{2}E}{x}}\tag{6.5}$$

for γ a positive constant. By deforming the contour appropriately, this is easily evaluated to

$$\sqrt{2}\,{\rm e}^{-4\pi|P|\sqrt{-E}}\tag{6.6}$$

However this is not quite the right result because of the illegal exchange of contours. As usual, the correct result is analytic in P and symmetric under exchange P → −P. Following the analogous more careful derivation of Saad, Shenker and Stanford [36, appendix A], shows that the operator insertion is actually the average of both sign choices in the exponent. This is the unique choice that is both reflection symmetric and analytic in P. Summarizing, we hence have for the first non-perturbative correction (that we denote by a superscript [1])

$${\sf V}_{n}^{(b)}(S_{0};P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})^{[1]}=\int_{-\infty}^{0}{\rm d}E\ \langle\varrho^{(b)}(E)\rangle\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{\sqrt{2}\sinh(4\pi P_{j}\sqrt{-E})}{P_{j}}\,\tag{6.7}$$

where ⟨ϱ (b) (E)⟩ is given by (6.1).

Non-perturbative (in)stability. Before continuing, we have to discuss an important issue. So far, the discussion makes it sound as if the non-perturbative corrections are unique. But this is actually not the case, because the integral in (6.7) is divergent unless b = 1. The reason for this is that unless b = 1, the sign of V (b) eff is indefinite and as a consequence, ⟨ϱ (b) (E)⟩ can be arbitrarily large for negative energies. This means that the model is nonperturbatively unstable and all eigenvalues will tunnel to minima of V (b) eff (E) at smaller and smaller energies. For b = 1 instead, V (b) eff (E) is monotonic and ⟨ϱ (b) (E)⟩ decays exponentially as E → −∞. Thus the model is non-perturbatively stable. These two different behaviours are depicted in figure 8.

The non-perturbative instability does not mean that the model is non-sensical. Instead, the simplest way out is to deform the integration contour over the eigenvalues of the matrix. This however means that the non-perturbative completion of the model is not unique. As we shall discuss in section 8.2, the same ambiguities also arise when we reproduce these nonperturbative corrections from the worldsheet. For example, we can deform the integration contour to run to an extremum of ⟨ϱ (b) (E)⟩ and then turn into the complex plane, as we do below.

Alternatively, one can also follow the route proposed in [111] to construct a different non-perturbative completion of the matrix integral, but it is not clear how to reproduce this structure from the worldsheet.

Single instanton contribution. Let us assume that b ̸= 1 for now. We discuss the special case b = 1 further below in subsection 6.3. Each possible instanton correction on the

![](_page_51_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 8: Plot of the effective potential V (b) eff (E) of the double-scaled Virasoro matrix integral in the region E < 0, for b close to one. For b ̸= 1 the effective potential is oscillatory, while for b exactly equal to one it is monotonically increasing.

worldsheet will be associated to one of the extrema of V (b) eff (E). They come in two infinite families and are located at

$$E^{*}_{k,\pm}=-\frac{k^{2}b^{\pm2}}{4},\quad k\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq1}.\tag{6.8}$$

For the one-instanton correction, we simply have to expand the integrand (6.7) around one of these saddle points. The corresponding non-perturbative correction is thus given by

V (b) n (S0; P1, . . . , Pn) [1] k,± = Z γk,± dE −1 8πE∗ k,± e −V (b) eff (E∗ k,±)− 1 2 (E−E∗ k,±) 2 (V (b) eff ) ′′(E∗ k,±) × Yn j=1 √ 2 sinh(4πPj p−E∗ k,± ) Pj = − i e −V (b) eff (E∗ k,±) 8πE∗ k,± s −π 2(V (b) eff ) ′′(E∗ k,± ) Yn j=1 √ 2 sinh(4πPj p−E∗ k,± ) Pj . (6.9)

The contour γk,± takes the form sketched in figure 9. We should also mention that we only kept the imaginary part of the expression (which does not get contributions from the real line), since it is the only unambiguous part of the contour integral. The result is only one half of the Gaussian integral, since the contour turns into the complex plane. This is explained in more detail in [60]. To bring this expression into a form that is interpretable in string theory, let us denote

$$T^{(b)}_{k,\pm}=V^{(b)}_{\rm eff}(E^{*}_{k,\pm})=\frac{4\sqrt{2}\,{\rm e}^{S_{0}}b^{\pm1}(-1)^{k+1}\sin(\pi kb^{\pm2})}{1-b^{\pm4}}.\tag{6.10}$$

![](_page_52_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 9: The integration contour γk,± for the computation of instanton corrections in the sector (k, ±). We could have also chosen the contour reflected at the real axis, which would lead to the opposite sign in the result (6.12). This reflects the ambiguity of the non-perturbative completion discussed above on the matrix integral side.

T (b) k,± has the physical interpretation of the tension of the corresponding ZZ-instanton in the bulk description. Notice that it may be positive or negative, reflecting that most of these instanton corrections should not live on the integration contour of the matrix integral. We will nonetheless be able to match them to the corresponding bulk quantities below. We also note that

$$(V^{(b)}_{\rm eff})^{\prime\prime}(E^{*}_{k,\pm})=T^{(b)}_{k,\pm}\frac{(V^{(b)}_{\rm eff})^{\prime\prime}(E^{*}_{k,\pm})}{V^{(b)}_{\rm eff}(E^{*}_{k,\pm})}=T^{(b)}_{k,\pm}\frac{4\pi^{2}(1-b^{\mp4})}{k^{2}}.\tag{6.11}$$

Thus we can rewrite (6.9) as

$${\sf V}_{n}^{(b)}(S_{0};P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})_{k,\pm}^{[1]}=\frac{i\,{\rm e}^{-T_{k,\pm}^{(b)}}}{2^{\frac{1}{2}}\pi^{\frac{1}{2}}(T_{k,\pm}^{(b)})^{\frac{1}{2}}(1-b^{\pm4})^{\frac{1}{2}}k}\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi b^{\pm1}P_{j})}{P_{j}}.\tag{6.12}$$

#### 6.2 Large g asymptotics of V (b) g,n

From the leading non-perturbative correction V (b) n (S0; P1, . . . , Pn) [1] to V (b) n (S0; P1, . . . , Pn), one can also determine the asymptotic behaviour of the quantum volumes V (b) g,n(P1, . . . , Pn) at large genus g using resurgence techniques. Assuming 0 < b < 1, the closest saddle-point to the origin is the contribution from the saddle point (6.8) (1, +). The existence of nonperturbative corrections indicates that the series (2.8) is asymptotic. Let us look at its Borel transform,

$$\widetilde{\mathsf{V}}_{n}^{(b)}(x;P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})=\sum_{g=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{2g}}{(2g)!}\,\mathsf{V}_{g,n}^{(b)}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\,\tag{6.13}$$

which has a finite radius of convergence in x. V (b) n (S0; P1, . . . , Pn) can then be recovered via a Laplace transform

$${\sf V}_{n}^{(b)}(S_{0};P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})={\rm e}^{-(n-2)S_{0}}\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!{\rm d}x\ {\rm e}^{-x}\,\widetilde{\sf V}_{n}^{(b)}(x\,{\rm e}^{-S_{0}};P_{1},\ldots,P_{n}).\tag{6.14}$$

In the cases of interest to us, Ve(b) n will have singularities on the real axis and thus the integral over x actually has to be deformed into the complex plane to give a non-perturbative completion of the summation. This leads to the same non-perturbative ambiguities that were already observed above. In particular, the large g asymptotics of V (b) g,n controls the radius of convergence of the Borel transform in the x-plane.

As we shall see, the quantum volumes, V (b) g,n(P1, . . . , Pn) have the following universal behaviour as g → ∞,

$${\rm V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\sim(2g)!\cdot AB^{g}g^{C}\tag{6.15}$$

for functions A, B and C depending on b and n that we will now determine. The (2g)! growth ensures that the Borel transform will have singularities in the x-plane. This behaviour implies that Ve(b) n (x; P1, . . . , Pn) behaves as

$$\bar{\bf V}_{n}^{(b)}(x;P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\sim A\,\Gamma(C+1)\,(1-Bx^{2})^{-C-1}+\mbox{less singular}\tag{6.16}$$

near the two singularities x = ± √ 1 B in the Borel plane. In particular, when C ̸∈ Z, the Borel transform has a branch cut running along the real axis starting from x = √ 1 B . We can then plug this behaviour into (6.14). The branch cut will lead to an imaginary part in the answer, which we can then compare with the first non-perturbative correction (6.12) of the quantum volumes. We deform the contour above the branch cut and only focus on the imaginary part of the answer. Thus resurgence predicts the following asymptotics of the quantum volumes

$${\sf V}_{n}^{(b)}(S_{0};P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})^{[1]}=i\,{\rm e}^{-(n-2)S_{0}}\int_{B^{-\frac{1}{2}}{\rm e}_{0}}^{\infty}{\rm d}x\ {\rm e}^{-x}A\,\Gamma(C+1)\ {\rm Im}(1-Bx^{2}\,{\rm e}^{-2S_{0}})^{-C-1}\tag{6.17}$$ $$\sim\frac{A\pi i}{2^{C+1}B^{\frac{C+1}{2}}}\,{\rm e}^{-B^{-\frac{1}{2}}\,\phi_{0}}{\rm e}^{(3+C-n)S_{0}}\.$$

Comparing to (6.12), we hence see that

$$B={\rm e}^{-2S_{0}}\big{(}T^{(b)}_{1,+}\big{)}^{-2}\,\qquad C=n-\frac{7}{2}\,\tag{6.18}$$

which is required to match the correct S0 dependence. The fact that this matches the S0 dependence of the non-perturbative correction to V (b) n justifies our ansatz (6.15) a posteriori. We can then compare the prefactors to conclude

$$A=\frac{\left({\rm e}^{S_{0}}T_{1,+}^{(b)}\right)^{2-n}}{2^{5}\pi^{\frac{5}{2}}(1-b^{4})^{\frac{1}{2}}}\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{2\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi bP_{j})}{P_{j}}.\tag{6.19}$$

To summarize, we have extracted the following large g behaviour of the quantum volumes,

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\stackrel{{g\geq1}}{{\sim}}\frac{\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{\sqrt{2\sinh(2\pi b)}}{P_{j}}}{2^{\frac{2}{2}\pi^{\frac{n}{4}}(1-b^{4})^{\frac{1}{2}}}}\times\left(\frac{4\sqrt{2}b\sin(\pi b^{2})}{1-b^{4}}\right)^{2-2g-n}\times\Gamma\big{(}2g+n-\frac{5}{2}\big{)}\,\tag{6.20}$$

where we need to assume that 0 < b < 1. We also assume in this formula that P1, . . . , Pn and b are held constant while taking the large g limit. It is interesting to note that even though the quantum volumes are all polynomial in P 2 j and c = 1 + 6(b + b −1 ) 2 , the large g asymptotics is highly non-polynomial. We should also note that this formula implies that the string coupling gs = e−S0 is renormalized to its effective value

$$g_{\rm s}^{\rm eff}=\frac{1-b^{4}}{4\sqrt{2b}\sin(\pi b^{2})}\,{\rm e}^{-S_{0}}=(T_{1,+}^{(b)})^{-1}.\tag{6.21}$$

Some consistency checks. We can perform some simple consistency checks on this expression. We first remark that (6.20) is consistent with the dilaton equation (4.15a) in a somewhat non-trivial way. The LHS of the string equation (4.15b) vanishes for the asymptotic formula (6.20). This is consistent with the right hand side, since it is suppressed by one power of 1 g .

Finally, (6.20) formally reduces to known formulas for the Weil-Petersson volumes when taking the limit b → 0. Using (2.22) as well as (2.24), we obtain

$$V_{g,n}(\ell_{1},\ldots,\ell_{n})\sim\frac{(4\pi^{2})^{2g-2+n}}{2^{\frac{3}{2}}\pi^{\frac{5}{2}}}\,\Gamma\big{(}2g+n-\frac{5}{2}\big{)}\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{2\sinh(\frac{\ell_{j}}{2})}{\ell_{j}}\,\tag{6.22}$$

which matches with the formulas derived in [36, 112–119]. In particular, [119] develops the large g asymptotics much more systematically beyond the leading order.

Explicit check. We can compare (6.20) explicitly against the first few quantum volumes as computed from intersection theory or the recursion relation (2.13). Let us first focus on the case n = 0. For the Weil-Petersson volumes, this was done in [112] using more efficient algorithms for the computation of the volumes. In our case, we do not know of such an algorithm and the most efficient method for the computation of the volumes is the direct computation via intersection numbers on moduli space. We were able to evaluate the volumes up to g = 12 directly. The Mathematica notebook implementing this is attached to the publication as an ancillary file. The ratio of the quantum volumes and the asymptotic formula is displayed in figure 10. We also extrapolated the result to g = ∞ by using the general fact that the corrections to the asymptotic formula (6.20) are of the form

$$\begin{array}{l}\mbox{$\mathsf{V}_{g,n}^{(b)}$}\\ \mbox{$\mathsf{(6.20)}$}\end{array}=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}x_{j}g^{-j}\.\tag{6.23}$$

This mirrors the fact that the string perturbation theory expansion is a power series in gs (as opposed to g 2 s ) in the one-instanton sector). We fitted x0, . . . , x10 from the data and plotted the asymptotic value given by x0.

Figure 10: The ratio of the exact volumes and the asymptotic formula (6.20) up to g = 12. The last curve is the extrapolation of the low g data to g = ∞.

From the figure, it is clear that the asymptotic formula is good for b well away from b = 1. This is expected since for b = 1, the saddle point approximation above breaks down because two saddles collide in that case.

We also checked the asymptotic formula for V (b) g,1 (P1). In figure 11, we plotted the ratio of the volume at genus 12 with the formula (6.20) as a function of P1. The approximation is good for b well away from b = 1 and P1 sufficiently small.

### 6.3 The special case b = 1

The case b = 1 needs to be treated separately. For b exactly equal to one the effective potential

$$V_{\rm eff}^{(b=1)}(E)=\sqrt{2}\,{\rm e}^{S_{0}}\left(4\pi\sqrt{-E}-\sin(4\pi\sqrt{-E})\right)\tag{6.24}$$

is no longer oscillatory (see figure 8). We will now repeat the analysis of sections 6.1 and 6.2 for this case. Our discussion will be rather brief, since many aspects are very similar.

![](_page_56_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 11: The ratio of the quantum volumes V (1) 12,1 and the asymptotic formula (6.20) for different values of b.

The one-instanton contribution. In this case, the extrema are located at

$$E_{k}^{*}=-\frac{k^{2}}{4}\,\quad k\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq1}.\tag{6.25}$$

They do not carry a subscript '+' or '−', since both cases coincide. In particular, all extrema of V (b=1) eff have vanishing second derivative. Thus in the saddle point evaluation of the integral (6.7), we have to go to subleading order in the integral. We take the contour to be a steepest descent contour in the complex plane. Only the imaginary part of the one-instanton contribution is unambiguous since the real part depends on the precise details of the contour. We have

V (1) n (S0; P1, . . . , Pn) [1] k = iIm Z γk dE −1 8πE∗ k e −V (1) eff (E∗ k )− 1 6 (E−E∗ k ) 3 (V (b) eff ) ′′′(E∗ k ) × Yn j=1 √ 2 sinh(4πPj p −E∗ k ) Pj = − i e −V (1) eff (E∗ k ) Γ( 1 3 ) 8πE∗ k − 4 √ 3(V (1) eff ) ′′′(E∗ k ) 1 3 Yn j=1 √ 2 sinh(4πPj p −E∗ k ) Pj = i e −2 √ 2kπe S0 Γ( 1 3 ) 8π 2k (4√ 6 eS0 ) 1 3 Yn j=1 √ 2 sinh(2πkPj ) Pj . (6.26)

Large genus asymptotics. To extract the large genus behaviour of the quantum volumes V (1) g,n, we proceed as above. Matching (6.17) and (6.26) with k = 1 yields the asymptotics

$${\sf V}^{(1)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\stackrel{{g\gg1}}{{\sim}}\frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{3})\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi P_{j})}{P_{j}}}{2^{\frac{2}{3}}3^{\frac{3}{6}}\pi^{\frac{2}{3}}}\left(\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}\pi}\right)^{2g-2+n}\Gamma\big{(}2g-\frac{7}{3}+n\big{)}.\tag{6.27}$$

Note that these quantum volumes grow slightly faster than the generic volumes, which is consistent with the fact that (6.20) diverges at b = 1. (6.27) is again consistent with the dilaton and the string equations (4.15a) and (4.15b), but we are not aware of simple checks beyond these.

## 7 Worldsheet string perturbation theory

In this section, we will study the Virasoro minimal string (1.1) directly using worldsheet string perturbation theory. As emphasized in the introduction and in figure 2, we interpret string diagrams as computing quantum volumes of the worldsheet, rather than in terms of amplitudes of asymptotic string states in target spacetime.

### 7.1 Torus one-point diagram

In string perturbation theory, the torus one-point diagram is evaluated as

$${\sf V}_{1,1}^{({\sf b})}(P_{1})=\frac{(2\pi)^{2}}{2}\int_{F_{0}}{\sf d}^{2}\tau\left\langle{\sf b}\,\widehat{\sf b}\,{\cal V}_{P_{1}}(0)\right\rangle_{g=1}\tag{7.1}$$ $$={\sf N}\,\frac{(2\pi)^{2}}{2}\int_{F_{0}}{\sf d}^{2}\tau\left|\eta(\tau)\right|^{4}\!\left\langle V_{P_{1}}(0)\right\rangle_{g=1}\!\left\langle\widehat{V}_{iP_{1}}(0)\right\rangle_{g=1}\,,$$

where F0 = {τ ∈ C| − 1 2 ≤ Re τ ≤ 1 2 , |τ | ≥ 1} is the fundamental domain of the torus moduli space, and where we used the definition (2.6) for the physical vertex operators and the fact that the normalization N(P) is independent of P, see eq. (3.22). In our conventions, d 2 τ = dτ1dτ2 where τ = τ1 + iτ2. Contrary to the sphere, see eq. (3.22), we do not have to introduce an additional arbitrary normalization CT2 of the string path integral, since there is no corresponding counterterm on the torus and the normalization of the path integral is unambiguous and thus CT2 = 1. The factor of (2π) 2 in (7.1) arises from the correct normalization of the ghost path integral, see e.g. [120, section 7.3]. Finally, the factor of 1 2 arises from the fact that each torus has a Z2 symmetry and we need to divide by the order of the automorphism group.

In our conventions, the Liouville one-point correlation functions on the torus T2 with modulus τ in (7.1) admit the following Virasoro conformal block decompositions

 VP1 (0) g=1 = Z ∞ 0 dP ρ(b) 0 (P)Cb(P1, P, P)F (b) 1,1 (P1; P|q)F (b) 1,1 (P1; P|q) , (7.2a)

$$\left\langle\widehat{V}_{iP_{1}}(0)\right\rangle_{g=1}=\int_{\cal C}{\rm d}\widehat{P}\frac{(i\widehat{P})^{2}}{2\rho_{0}^{(b)}(i\widehat{P})}\,\widehat{C}_{b}(iP_{1},\widehat{P},\widehat{P}){\cal F}_{1,1}^{(b)}(iP_{1};\widehat{P}|q){\cal F}_{1,1}^{(b)}(iP_{1};\widehat{P}|\overline{q})\,\tag{7.2b}$$

where F (b) 1,1 (P1; P|q) is the holomorphic torus one-point Virasoro conformal block at central charge c = 1 + 6(b + b −1 ) 2 with external weight hP1 = 1 4 (b + b −1 ) 2 + P 2 1 and internal weight hP = 1 4 (b + b −1 ) 2 + P 2 , evaluated at a value of the parameter q = e2πiτ where τ is the modulus of the torus. The contour of integration C over the intermediate states with Liouville momentum Pb in the ˆc ≤ 1 torus one-point function (7.2b) is chosen as depicted in figure 5.

The torus one-point Virasoro conformal block F (b) 1,1 (P1; P|q) can be expressed as [121,122]

$${\cal F}^{(b)}_{1,1}(P_{1};P|q)=q^{P^{2}-\frac{1}{24}}\left(\prod_{m=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{1-q^{m}}\right){\cal H}^{(b)}_{1,1}(P_{1};P|q)\,\tag{7.3}$$

where the so-called elliptic conformal block H (b) 1,1 (P1; P|q) admits a power series expansion in q that starts at 1 and that can be computed efficiently with a recursion relation in the internal weight hP , as briefly reviewed in appendix C.2. Decomposing the Liouville one-point functions in (7.1) into Virasoro conformal blocks and making use of (7.3) we obtain that the torus one-point diagram in Virasoro minimal string theory takes the form,

$$\mathsf{V}_{1,1}^{(b)}(P_{1})=\mathrm{N}\,\frac{(2\pi)^{2}}{2}\int_{F_{0}}\mathrm{d}^{2}\tau\int_{0}^{\infty}\mathrm{d}P\,\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)C_{b}(P_{1},P,P)|q|^{2P^{2}}\mathcal{H}_{1,1}^{(b)}(P_{1};P|q)\mathcal{H}_{1,1}^{(b)}(P_{1};P|\overline{q})$$ $$\times\int_{\mathcal{C}}\mathrm{d}\widehat{P}\,\frac{(i\widehat{P})^{2}}{2\rho_{0}^{(b)}(i\widehat{P})}\widehat{C}_{b}(iP_{1},\widehat{P},\widehat{P})|q|^{2P^{2}}\mathcal{H}_{1,1}^{(b)}(iP_{1};\widehat{P}|q)\mathcal{H}_{1,1}^{(b)}(iP_{1};\widehat{P}|\overline{q}).\tag{7.4}$$

As discussed in section 3, an interesting feature of the Virasoro minimal string background (1.1) is that string diagrams in string perturbation theory are manifestly finite for any physical value of the external momenta of the closed strings. This is in contrast to more familiar string backgrounds in which divergences arise in degenerating limits of moduli space and the string diagram (for example, a string S-matrix element) is typically defined via analytic continuation from unphysical values of the external closed string momenta for which the string diagram moduli space integral converges [120].

Analytic evaluation of V (b) 1,1 (P1) for two special values of P1. There are a couple of cases in which the torus one-point Virasoro conformal block is known explicitly, for all values of the central charge. The most obvious is the case in which the external operator is the identity, with P1 = iQ 2 , in which case the conformal block is simply given by the corresponding non-degenerate Virasoro character with (internal) weight P,

$${\cal F}_{1,1}^{(b)}\big{(}P_{1}=\frac{iQ}{2};P|\tau\big{)}=\chi_{P}^{(b)}(\tau)=\frac{{\rm e}^{2\pi i\tau P^{2}}}{\eta(\tau)}.\tag{7.5}$$

The second case is less obvious. It turns out that when the external weight is equal to one, with P1 = i 2 (b −1−b) = iQb 2 , then the torus-one point block is also given by the non-degenerate Virasoro character [123]

$${\cal F}_{1,1}^{(b)}\big{(}P_{1}=\frac{i\hat{Q}}{2};P|\tau\big{)}=\chi_{P}^{(b)}(\tau).\tag{7.6}$$

In other words, in both cases the elliptic conformal block (7.3) is precisely equal to one, H (b) 1,1 (P1; P|q) = 1 for P1 = iQ 2 and P1 = iQb 2 . In both these cases, P1 ̸∈ R. But these values still fall in the range of analyticity of V (b) g,n since the contour in the conformal block decomposition does not need to be deformed; see section 3.1.

For the case P1 = iQb 2 , using the following limit of the three-point coefficient

$$C_{b}(\frac{i\bar{Q}}{2},P,P)=\frac{2P^{2}}{\pi Q\rho_{0}(P)}\,\tag{7.7}$$

as well as (3.6), we obtain that the torus one-point diagram (7.4) evaluates to,

V (b) 1,1 (P1 = iQb 2 ) = N (2π) 2 2 Z F0 d 2 τ Z ∞ 0 dP ρ(b) 0 (P)Cb( iQb 2 , P, P) e−4πτ2P 2 × Z C dPb (iPb) 2 2ρ (b) 0 (iPb) Cbb( Qb 2 , P , b Pb) e−4πτ2Pb2 = N (2π) 2 2 Z F0 d 2 τ Z ∞ 0 dP P2 e −4πτ2P 2 Z ∞ −∞ dPb 2 e −4πτ2Pb2 = N(2π) 2 2 1 128π Z F0 d 2 τ τ −2 2 = N π 2 192 . (7.8)

This precisely agrees with (2.19b) evaluated at P1 = iQb 2 , provided that

$${\rm N}=\frac{4}{\pi^{2}}.\tag{7.9}$$

Therefore, making use of (3.22) we obtain that

$$C_{\rm S^{2}}=\frac{\pi^{6}}{64}.\tag{7.10}$$

The torus one-point diagram in the case P = iQ 2 proceeds essentially identically, except that slightly more care is required in taking the limit. The issue is that the relevant structure constant diverges in this limit

$$C_{b}(i(\frac{Q}{2}-\varepsilon),P,P)=\frac{1}{\pi\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)}\,\varepsilon^{-1}+O(\varepsilon^{0})\,.\tag{7.11}$$

For this reason the spacelike Liouville correlator diverges and the timelike Liouville correlator vanishes but the combination that appears on the worldsheet remains finite. We find that

$${\sf V}_{1,1}^{(b)}(P_{1}=\frac{iQ}{2})={\rm N}\frac{(2\pi)^{2}}{2}\int_{F_{0}}{\rm d}^{2}\tau\int_{0}^{\infty}{\rm d}P\,{\rm e}^{-4\pi\tau_{2}P^{2}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{{\rm d}\widehat{P}}{2}\,(-\widehat{P}^{2})\,{\rm e}^{-4\pi\tau_{2}\widehat{P}^{2}}\tag{7.12}$$ $$=-{\rm N}\,\frac{\pi^{2}}{192}\,$$

which also exactly agrees with (2.19b) evaluated at P1 = iQ 2 provided (7.9) is satisfied.

Direct numerical evaluation of V (b) 1,1 (P1) for generic values of P1. Let us first be more explicit about the behavior of the torus one-point diagram (7.4) near the cusp τ2 → ∞ of the fundamental domain. In this limit, since to leading order at large τ2 the torus one-point elliptic conformal blocks H (b) 1,1 (P1; P|q) ≃ 1, the moduli integral of (7.4) behaves as

$$\int^{\infty}{\rm d}\tau_{2}\int_{0}^{\infty}{\rm d}P\ \rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)C_{b}(P_{1},P,P)\,{\rm e}^{-4\pi\tau_{2}P^{2}}\int_{\cal C}{\rm d}\widehat{P}\ \frac{(i\widehat{P})^{2}}{2\rho_{0}^{(b)}(i\widehat{P})}\,\widehat{C}_{b}(iP_{1},\widehat{P},\widehat{P})\,{\rm e}^{-4\pi\tau_{2}P^{2}}.\tag{7.13}$$

In the limit τ2 → ∞, the integrals over the intermediate Liouville momenta P and Pb are dominated by their values near P = 0 and Pb = 0. Using Laplace's method, we can approximate these integrals as an asymptotic expansion at large τ2 by

Z ∞ 0 dP ρ(b) 0 (P)Cb(P1, P, P) e−4πτ2P 2 ∼ X n∈2Z≥0 2 −2(n+1)π − n 2 Γ(n 2 + 1) τ − n+1 2 2 d n dP n     P =0 ρ (b) 0 (P)Cb(P1, P, P) , (7.14a) Z C dPb (iPb) 2 2ρ (b) 0 (iPb) Cbb(iP1, P , b Pb) e−4πτ2Pb2 ∼ X m∈2Z≥0 2 −2m−1)π − m 2 Γ(m 2 + 1) τ − m+1 2 2 d m dPbm     Pˆ=0 (iPb) 2 2ρ (b) 0 (iPb) Cbb(iP1, P , b Pb) . (7.14b)

For instance, the first nonzero terms in the asymptotic expansions are the m = 0 and n = 2 terms on the RHS of (7.14), from which we obtain that the moduli integral (7.13) behaves

$28\mathrm{S}$.

$$\frac{1}{128\pi}\int^{\infty}\!\!{\rm d}\tau_{2}\ \tau_{2}^{-2}\,\tag{7.15}$$

and is therefore convergent, as claimed in section 3.1.

In the direct numerical evaluation of (7.4), we will employ the strategy of [41]. We split the fundamental domain F0 of the torus moduli space into two regions: (I) τ ∈ F0 with τ2 ≤ τ max 2 , and (II) τ ∈ F0 with τ2 ≥ τ max 2 , for a sufficiently large value of τ max 2 . In region (I), we first perform the integrals over the intermediate Liouville momenta Pb and P separately and for a fixed value of τ . These two integrations are performed numerically with the elliptic conformal blocks H (ib) 1,1 (iP1; Pb|q) and H (b) 1,1 (P1; P|q) computed via the recursion relation (C.12) and truncated to order q 8 . The integration over τ in region (I) is then performed numerically. In region (II), we may approximate the moduli integrand by the expressions in (7.13) and (7.14); the moduli integral can then be done analytically. We include a sufficient number of terms in the asymptotic expansions (7.14) such that the resulting moduli integral over region (II) is accurate to order (τ max 2 ) −3 .

For the numerical evaluation of the torus one-point diagram, we will consider values of the Liouville parameter b such that b 2 is a rational number. As discussed in appendix C, for such values of b the Liouville three-point coefficients (3.1) and (3.6) can be expressed in terms of the Barnes G-function and thus their numerical implementation is much faster, as opposed to resorting to the integral representation of the Γb(x) function. For some rational values of b 2 , the numerical calculation of the torus one-point elliptic Virasoro conformal blocks H (b) 1,1 (P1; P|q) through the recursion relation (C.12) involves delicate cancellations. In order to avoid loss of precision, we compute the conformal blocks with a central charge corresponding to b = (m n ) 1 2 + δ and ˆb = (m n ) 1 2 + δ, with m, n ∈ Z≥1, with the choice of small δ = 10−7 for the c ≥ 25 and ˆc ≤ 1 Liouville CFT sectors, respectively. Lastly, in the numerical calculation of (7.4) we parametrize the contour of integration C over the intermediate ˆc ≤ 1 Liouville momentum by Pb = p + iϵ with p ∈ R and ϵ = 10−1 , and set τ max 2 = 15 in the splitting of the fundamental domain F0 described in the previous paragraph.

Figures 12 and 13 show numerical results for the torus one-point diagram (7.4) in Virasoro minimal string theory, with the fixed value (7.9) for the normalization constant N, computed with the strategy outlined above. Figure 12 shows results for the torus one-point diagram as a function of the external closed string momenta in the range P1 ∈ [0, 1], for the following four choices of the Liouville parameter b = 1, 2 − 1 2 , 3 − 1 2 , 4 − 1 2 . 17 Figure 13 shows results for the torus one-point diagram as a function of the spacelike Liouville CFT central charge in the range c ∈ [25, 26], for three choices of external closed string momenta P1 = 1 3 , 1 2 , 2 3 .

<sup>17</sup>The numerical results for b = 1 agree with those of [41], which followed a different normalization convention for the c = 25 and c = 1 Liouville CFT three-point coefficients.

Figure 12: Shown in dots are the numerical results for the torus one-point string diagram (7.4) in Virasoro minimal string theory for a range of external momentum P1 ∈ [0, 1] of the asymptotic closed string state, for the choice of the Liouville parameter b = 1, 2 − 1 2 , 3 − 1 2 , 4 − 1 2 as labeled in the plot. The exact result (7.16) is shown in the solid curve.

These numerical results exhibit a remarkable level of agreement with the exact result (2.19b)

$${\sf V}_{1,1}^{(b)}(P_{1})=\frac{1}{24}\left(\frac{c-13}{24}+P_{1}^{2}\right)\,\tag{7.16}$$

and provide a highly nontrivial direct check of the duality. The largest discrepancy between the numerical results shown in figure 12 and the exact result (7.16) is of order 10−4 % for b = 1, 2 − 1 2 and 10−3 % for b = 3− 1 2 , 4 − 1 2 . Likewise, the largest discrepancy between the numerical results in figure 13 and the function (7.16) is of order 10−4 %.

### 7.2 Sphere four-point diagram

Next, we consider the four-punctured sphere diagram in Virasoro minimal string theory. After using its conformal Killing group to fix the positions of three vertex operators Vj (zj , zj ) with j = 1, 3, 4 to z1 = 0, z3 = 1, and z4 = ∞, the sphere four-point diagram has one remaining modulus, the position z ∈ C of the last vertex operator V2(z, z), and takes the form

![](_page_63_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 13: Shown in dots are the numerical results for the torus one-point string diagram (7.4) in Virasoro minimal string theory for a fixed value of external momentum P1 = 1 3 , 1 2 , 2 3 of the asymptotic closed string state, as labeled in each curve, and for varying central charge c ∈ [25, 26]. Specifically, the data points calculated numerically correspond to b 2 = 9 10 , 5 6 , 4 5 , 7 9 , 3 4 , 8 11 , 5 7 , 7 10 , 9 13 , 2 3 for each value of P1. The exact result (7.16) is shown in the solid curve.

$$\mathsf{V}^{(0)}_{0,1}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4})=C_{\mathbb{S}^{2}}\mathbb{N}^{4}\int_{\mathbb{C}}\mathrm{d}^{2}z\left\langle V_{P_{1}}(0)V_{P_{2}}(z,\overline{z})V_{P_{3}}(1)V_{P_{4}}(\infty)\right\rangle_{g=0}$$ $$\times\left\langle\widehat{V}_{iP_{1}}(0)\widehat{V}_{iP_{2}}(z,\overline{z})\widehat{V}_{iP_{3}}(1)\widehat{V}_{iP_{4}}(\infty)\right\rangle_{g=0}.\tag{7.17}$$

The Liouville CFT sphere four-point functions in (7.17) admit the following Virasoro conformal block decompositions,

 VP1 (0)VP2 (z, z)VP3 (1)VP4 (∞) g=0 = Z ∞ 0 dP ρ(b) 0 (P)Cb(P1, P2, P)Cb(P3, P4, P) × F(b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4; P|z)F (b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4; P|z) , (7.18a) VbiP1 (0)VbiP2 (z, z)VbiP3 (1)VbiP4 (∞) g=0 = Z C dPb (iPb) 2 2ρ (b) 0 (iPb) Cbb(iP1, iP2, Pb)Cbb(iP3, iP4, Pb) × F(ib) 0,4 (iP1, iP2, iP3, iP4; Pb|z)F (ib) 0,4 (iP1, iP2, iP3, iP4; Pb|z) , (7.18b)

where F (b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4; P|z) is the sphere four-point holomorphic Virasoro conformal block with external weights hPi = Q2 4 + P 2 i for i = 1, . . . , 4, intermediate weight hP = Q2 4 + P 2 , evaluated at the cross-ratio z. Further, the conformal block F (b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4; P|z) can be expressed in terms of an elliptic conformal block H (b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4; P|q) as [124]

$${\cal F}^{(b)}_{0,4}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4};P|z)=(16q)^{\rho z}z^{-\frac{q^{2}}{4}-P_{4}^{2}-P_{4}^{2}}(1-z)^{-\frac{q^{2}}{4}-P_{2}^{2}-P_{3}^{2}}\theta_{3}(q)^{-Q^{2}-4(P_{1}^{2}+P_{2}^{2}+P_{3}^{2}+P_{4}^{2})}\tag{7.19}$$ $$\times{\cal H}^{(b)}_{0,4}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4};P|q)\,$$

where θ3(q) is a Jacobi theta function, and the elliptic nome q is related to the cross-ratio z by

$$q(z)=\exp\Big{(}-\pi\,\frac{K(1-z)}{K(z)}\Big{)}\,\qquad\mbox{where}K(z)={}_{2}F_{1}(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2};1|z).\tag{7.20}$$

The elliptic conformal block H (b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4; P|q) admits a power series expansion in q that can be efficiently computed via Zamolodchikov's recursion relation, as reviewed in appendix C.2. Whereas the conformal block expansion in the cross ratio z a priori converges only in the unit z-disk (|z| < 1), the expansion in the elliptic nome q variable converges everywhere inside the unit q-disk, which in particular covers the entire complex z-plane [125]. Furthermore, at any given point in the z-plane, the conformal block expansion in the q variable converges much faster.

The crossing symmetry relations of the ˆc ≤ 1 and c ≥ 25 Liouville CFT sphere four-point correlation functions (7.18), generated by (C.15) and (C.16), may be used to reduce the moduli integration of the four-point diagram (7.17) over the complex z-plane into a finite domain near z = 0 [126, 127]. We divide the complex z-plane into six regions: (1) Re z ≤ 1 2 , |1 − z| ≤ 1, (2) |z| ≤ 1, |1 − z| ≥ 1, (3) Re z ≤ 1 2 , |z| ≥ 1, (4) Re z ≥ 1 2 , |z| ≤ 1, (5) |1 − z| ≤ 1, |z| ≥ 1, and (6) Re z ≥ 1 2 , |1 − z| ≥ 1. Denoting the transformation z → 1 − z, for which (C.15) holds, by T and the transformation z → z −1 , for which (C.16) holds, by S, the regions (2)–(6) can be mapped to region (1) by the transformations ST S, T S, T, ST, S, respectively. Hence, the four-point string diagram (7.17) can be written as

$$\mathsf{V}_{0,4}^{(b)}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4})=C_{S^{2}}\mathrm{N}^{4}\int\limits_{\mathrm{reg}\,(1)}\mathrm{d}^{2}z\,\left[\left\langle\widehat{V}_{iP_{1}}(0)\widehat{V}_{iP_{2}}(z,\overline{z})\widehat{V}_{iP_{3}}(1)\widehat{V}_{iP_{4}}(\infty)\right\rangle_{g=0}\right.$$ $$\left.\times\left\langle V_{P_{1}}(0)V_{P_{2}}(z,\overline{z})V_{P_{3}}(1)V_{P_{4}}(\infty)\right\rangle_{g=0}\right.$$ $$\left.+\left(5\text{other perms of}\{123\}\right)\right]\,.\tag{7.21}$$

Lastly, performing a change of variable defined by

$$t=i\,\frac{K(1-z)}{K(z)}\,\tag{7.22}$$

Figure 14: The fundamental domain in the cross ratio z-plane of the sphere four-point diagram, region (1) = {z ∈ C | Re z ≤ 1 2 , |1 − z| ≤ 1}, is mapped to the fundamental domain F0 = {t ∈ C | − 1 2 ≤ Re t ≤ 1 2 , |t| ≥ 1} in the complex t-plane via the change of variables (7.22).

from the cross-ratio z to the complex t-plane, such that the elliptic nome is q = eiπt, region (1) of the complex z-plane is mapped to the fundamental domain F0 = {t ∈ C | − 1 2 ≤ Re t ≤ 1 2 , |t| ≥ 1} in the complex t-plane. Decomposing the Liouville CFT four-point functions in (7.17) into Virasoro conformal blocks, making use of (7.19), performing the change of variables (7.22),18 and plugging in the constant values (7.9) and (7.10), we obtain that the four-point string diagram in Virasoro minimal string theory can be written as

V (b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4) = 4 Z F0 d 2 t Z ∞ 0 dP ρ(b) 0 (P)Cb(P1, P2, P)Cb(P3, P4, P) × |16q| 2P 2 H (b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4; P|q)H (b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4; P|q) × Z C dPb (iPb) 2 2ρ (b) 0 (iPb) Cbb(iP1, iP2, Pb)Cbb(iP3, iP4, Pb) × |16q| 2Pb2 H (ib) 0,4 (iP1, iP2, iP3, iP4; Pb|q)H (ib) 0,4 (iP1, iP2, iP3, iP4; Pb|q) + 5 other perms of {123} , (7.24)

As was the case for the torus one-point diagram considered in the previous section, the sphere four-point diagram takes the slightly simpler form (7.24) when expressed in terms of the elliptic Virasoro conformal blocks.

18The Jacobian of the map from the cross-ratio z to the elliptic nome q = eiπt

$$\left|\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|^{2}=\left|\pi i\Big{(}\frac{\theta_{2}(q)\theta_{4}(q)}{\theta_{3}(q)}\Big{)}^{4}\right|^{2}\tag{7.23}$$

exactly cancels the combined prefactors appearing in the product of the conformal blocks (7.19).

Analytic evaluation of V (b=1) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4) for special values of Pi and b. Unlike the case of the torus one-point diagram, we are not aware of any value of the conformal weights for which we can compute both the timelike and spacelike Liouville CFT four-point functions exactly for any value of the central charge. However, for the special case of c = 25, or b = 1, with external weights all equal to hi = 15 16 , as well as for the case of c = 1, or b = i, with external weights all equal to hˆ i = 1 16 , the elliptic sphere four-point blocks (7.19) are known to be given simply by [128]

$${\cal H}^{(b=1)}_{0,4}(\,\frac{i}{4},\frac{i}{4},\frac{i}{4},\frac{i}{4};P|q)=1\,\qquad{\cal H}^{(b=i)}_{0,4}(\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4};\widehat{P}|q)=1\,\tag{7.25}$$

respectively. For this special case, and making use of

$$C_{b=1}(\frac{i}{4},\frac{i}{4},P)=\frac{2^{-\frac{11}{2}-4P^{2}}P}{\sinh(2\pi P)}\,\tag{7.26}$$

we obtain that the sphere four-point diagram (7.24) evaluates to

V (b=1) 0,4 ( i 4 , i 4 , i 4 , i 4 ) = 6 × 4 Z F0 d 2 t Z ∞ 0 dP ρ(b) 0 (P)C1( i 4 , i 4 , P) 2 2 8P 2 e −2πt2P 2 × Z C dPb (iPb) 2 2ρ (b) 0 (iPb) Cb1( i 4 , i 4 , Pb) 2 2 8Pb2 e −2πt2Pb2 = 24 Z F0 d 2 t Z ∞ 0 dP P2 e −2πt2P 2 Z ∞ −∞ dPb 2 e −2πt2Pb2 = 1 4 , (7.27)

which exactly agrees with (2.19a) evaluated at c = 25 with Pi = i 4 .

Direct numerical evaluation of V (b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4) for generic values of Pi and b. The behavior of each of the six terms in (7.24) near the cusp t2 → ∞ of the fundamental domain F0 in the complex t-plane, with t = t1 + it2, can be analyzed similarly to the case of the torus one-point diagram considered in the previous section. In the limit t2 → ∞, the sphere four-point elliptic conformal blocks H (b) 0,4 (Pi ; P|q) ≃ 1 and using Laplace's method we can approximate the ˆc ≤ 1 and c ≥ 25 Liouville correlation functions as an asymptotic expansion at large t2 by

$$\int_{0}^{\infty}\!{\rm d}P\,\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},P)C_{b}(P_{3},P_{4},P)\,{\rm e}^{-(2\pi t_{2}-8\log2)P^{2}}$$ $$\sim\sum_{n\in{\mathbb{Z}}_{2\geq0}}\frac{2^{-(n+1)}\pi^{\frac{1}{2}}(2\pi t_{2}-8\log2)^{-\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\Gamma(\frac{n}{2}+1)}\,\frac{{\rm d}^{n}}{{\rm d}P^{n}}\Big{|}_{P=0}\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)C(P_{1},P_{2},P)C(P_{3},P_{4},P)\,\tag{7.28a}$$

and similarly for the other five terms in (7.24). For example, taking the first nonzero terms in the asymptotic expansions (7.28) we obtain that the full moduli integral in the sphere four-point string diagram (7.24) behaves as

$$6\times\frac{1}{32\pi}\int^{\infty}{\rm d}t_{2}\ t_{2}^{-2}\,\tag{7.29}$$

and is therefore convergent, as discussed in section 3.1.

With the four-point sphere diagram written in the form (7.24), we can then follow precisely the same strategy of numerical integration that we employed in the computation of the torus one-point string diagram described in the previous section.19 We split the fundamental domain F0 in the complex t-plane into two regions: (I) t ∈ F0 with t2 ≤ t max 2 , where we first perform the integrals over the intermediate Liouville momenta P and Pb, and then over the modulus t numerically, and (II) t ∈ F0 with t2 ≥ t max 2 , where we use the asymptotic expansions of the form (7.28) and perform the moduli integral over t analytically, including a sufficient number of terms in the asymptotic expansions such that the resulting integral is accurate to order (t max 2 ) −4 . In the direct numerical evaluation of (7.24), we compute the elliptic conformal blocks H (b) 0,4 (Pi ; P|q) via the recursion relation (C.10) with a central charge corresponding to b = (m n ) 1 2 + δ and ˆb = (m n ) 1 2 + δ with m, n ∈ Z≥1 and the choice of small δ = 10−6 for the c ≥ 25 and ˆc ≤ 1 Liouville CFT sectors, respectively, both truncated to order q 8 ; parametrize the contour of integration C over the intermediate ˆc ≤ 1 Liouville momentum by Pb = p + iε with p ∈ R and ε = 10−1 ; and set t max 2 = 15.

For the direct numerical evaluation of the four-point string diagram (7.24) we will make the following choices for the external momenta of the asymptotic closed string states and for the Liouville parameter b of the c ≥ 25 Liouville CFT sector of the Virasoro minimal string

<sup>19</sup>In [40], the moduli integral of the sphere four-point diagram was numerically computed directly in the cross-ratio variable z ∈ region I, which led to less precise results compared to the computations performed in this paper. More importantly, [40] followed a different strategy in which the order of integrations is switched – first integrate over the cross-ratio z and then over the intermediate Liouville momenta P and Pb; this order proved to be more convenient in the numerical evaluation of string scattering amplitudes in two-dimensional string theory of [127, 129, 130]. With that order of integrations, it was necessary to introduce regulator counterterms to the moduli integral (7.21), which appears to have led to a systematic error in the numerical results for the sphere four-point diagram V (b) 0,4 . In the notation of equation (3.11) of [40], the results of the present paper are α = 8 and β = 16.

external closed string momenta (7.30), computed with the strategy outlined above, are shown in figure 15. We again find that the numerical results demonstrate a remarkable agreement with the exact form for the string four-point diagram (2.19a),

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{0,4}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4})=\frac{c-13}{24}+P_{1}^{2}+P_{2}^{2}+P_{3}^{2}+P_{4}^{2}.\tag{7.31}$$

This agreement provides again highly nontrivial evidence for our proposed duality. For the results presented in figure 15, the largest discrepancy between the numerical results in the data sets (7.30) and the exact result (7.31) is of order 10−4 % for b = 1, 2 − 1 2 and 10−3 % for b = 3− 1 2 , 4 − 1 2 .

### 7.3 Sphere partition function and other exceptional cases

So far, we have discussed V (b) g,n for 2g − 2 + n ≥ 0, where the moduli space Mg,n in (2.7) is well-defined. However, one can also discuss the remaining exceptional cases, which we do now. Especially on the sphere, this is subtle, because the volume of the conformal Killing vector group is infinite for n ≤ 2 and because of non-compactness of the worldsheet CFT the result is formally given by a ratio ∞ ∞. Our main tool is to assume that the dilaton (4.15a) and string equations (4.15b) continue to hold, which allows us to relate these lower-point functions to higher-point functions.

Torus partition function. Let us start with the torus partition function. The dilaton equation implies that the torus partition function diverges:

$$0\cdot{\sf V}^{(b)}_{1,0}={\sf V}^{(b)}_{1,1}(P=\frac{i\hat{Q}}{2})-{\sf V}^{(b)}_{1,1}(P=\frac{iQ}{2})=\frac{1}{24}\neq0.\tag{7.32}$$

Since the right-hand-side is non-zero, this implies that the torus partition function is infinite. This can also be checked directly from the worldsheet and is a reflection of the fact that the torus partition function of Liouville theory diverges.

Sphere two-point function. The sphere two-point function needs to satisfy the dilaton equation, but this does not give any non-trivial information. Instead, we observe from the worldsheet definition (2.7) that the two-point functions on the worldsheet are only nonvanishing for P1 = P2 and thus we necessarily have20

${\rm V}^{(b)}_{0,2}(P_{1},P_{2})=F(P_{1})\delta(P_{1}-P_{2})$.

<sup>20</sup>The worldsheet two-point function is actually proportional to δ(P1 − P2) 2 , since we get a delta-function from both spacelike and timelike Liouville theory. The square in the delta-function can then get cancelled by the infinite volume of the conformal Killing vector group [131].

We can fix F(P1) by looking at the string equation (4.15b)

$$1=\sum_{j=1}^{2}\int_{0}^{P_{j}}2P_{j}\,{\rm d}P_{j}\ {\sf V}_{0,2}^{(b)}(P_{1},P_{2})\,\tag{7.34}$$

which fixes

$${\sf V}_{0,2}^{(b)}(P_{1},P_{2})=\frac{1}{2P_{1}}\,\delta(P_{1}-P_{2})=\delta(h_{1}-h_{2})\,\tag{7.35}$$

where we expressed it in terms of the conformal weight in the last step. This could have been expected from the spacetime picture, since we can obtain a double-trumpet either by gluing two trumpets or by using eq. (2.18) for g = 0 and n = 2. Thus the two-point volume should be just a delta-function in the natural measure 2P dP. We also would have concluded this from the inverse Laplace transform of the resolvent R (b) 0,2 (5.9).

Sphere one-point function. The one-point function on the sphere can be obtained directly from (7.35) via the dilaton equation (4.15a). We have

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{0,1}(P)={\sf V}^{(b)}_{0,2}(P,\frac{iQ}{2})-{\sf V}^{(b)}_{0,2}(P,\frac{iQ}{2})=\delta(h)-\delta(h-1).\tag{7.36}$$

This could again be expected from the disk partition function, since gluing a trumpet to this object according to (2.18) gives back the disk partition function (2.16a). In particular, for states in the spectrum for which P > 0, the one-point function on the sphere vanishes. Vanishing of the generic sphere one-point function was anticipated in [41] based on the well-behavedness of the string perturbation expansion.

Sphere partition function. Finally, the zero-point function on the sphere follows again from the dilaton equation:

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{0,0}=\frac{1}{2}\big{(}{\sf V}^{(b)}_{0,1}(\frac{iQ}{2})-{\sf V}^{(b)}_{0,1}(\frac{iQ}{2})\big{)}=\frac{1}{2}\big{(}\delta(0)+\delta(0)\big{)}=\infty.\tag{7.37}$$

Like the torus partition function, also the sphere partition is divergent. This feature is also believed to be a property of JT gravity [132, 133].

## 8 Asymptotic boundaries and ZZ-instantons

In this section we elucidate the worldsheet boundary conditions needed to describe configurations with asymptotic boundaries in Virasoro minimal string theory. We will see that this involves pairing a non-standard basis of FZZT branes for spacelike Liouville CFT described in section 3.2 together with ZZ-like boundary conditions (a good choice turns out to be the "half-ZZ" branes introduced in section 3.2) for timelike Liouville CFT. Equipped with these boundary conditions, we will then derive the disk and trumpet partition functions (given in equations (2.16a) and (2.16b) respectively), as well as the double-trumpet partition function directly from the worldsheet BCFT. We then proceed to investigate non-perturbative effects mediated by ZZ-instantons on the worldsheet. In particular, we determine the normalization of the one-instanton contributions to the free energy, finding a perfect match with the matrix integral as computed in section 6.1. Finally, we compute the leading non-perturbative corrections to the quantum volumes as mediated by ZZ-instantons.

### 8.1 Asymptotic boundaries

We now discuss the incorporation of asymptotically Euclidean AdS boundaries to Virasoro minimal string theory through conformal boundary conditions for the worldsheet CFT. The quantum volumes V (b) g,n(P1, . . . , Pn) computed by closed string perturbation theory as in (2.7) correspond to configurations with n geodesic boundaries with lengths that are given in the JT limit (b → 0) by [134]

$\ell_{i}=4\pi bP_{i}$.

In order to introduce asymptotic boundaries, we glue "trumpets" — punctured disks with boundary conditions to be described shortly — onto the string diagrams with finite boundaries as described in section 2.5. The punctures are labelled by a Liouville momentum Pi and create finite boundaries (which are to be glued onto those of the quantum volumes), with lengths that in the JT limit are given by (8.1). Then what we seek is a boundary condition for the worldsheet CFT corresponding to an asymptotic boundary with fixed (renormalized) length βi .

As reviewed in section 3.2, Liouville CFT admits two main families of conformal boundary conditions. In order to develop some intuition for them and their interpretation in Virasoro minimal string theory, recall that the Virasoro minimal string admits a reformulation in terms of two-dimensional dilaton gravity defined in (2.1), where the dilaton and Weyl factor of the target space metric can be recast in terms of the spacelike and timelike Liouville fields ϕ and χ as in (2.2). The one-parameter family of FZZT branes [84,85] admit a semiclassical reformulation in terms of a modified Neumann boundary condition for the Liouville fields, and hence may heuristically be thought of as extended branes. In contrast, the ZZ conformal boundary conditions [83] may semiclassically be thought of as Dirichlet boundary conditions for the Liouville field and hence represent localized branes. Indeed, as reviewed in section 3.2, the open-string spectrum of the cylinder partition functions with FZZT boundary conditions is continuous, while it is discrete for the ZZ-type boundary conditions.

Thus in order to introduce asymptotic boundaries in Virasoro minimal string theory, we will need to equip the spacelike and timelike Liouville sectors of the worldsheet CFT with a suitable combination of FZZT and ZZ-type boundary conditions. In particular, we claim that an ansatz that correctly reproduces matrix integral results is to equip the spacelike Liouville theory with FZZT boundary conditions and the timelike Liouville theory with the "half-ZZ" boundary conditions introduced in section 3.2.

Let us first discuss the FZZT boundary conditions for spacelike Liouville theory. Recall that the FZZT branes are labeled by a continuous parameter s. We claim that fixing the renormalized length of the asymptotic boundary is achieved by working in a basis of FZZT boundary states that is Laplace-dual to the fixed-s basis, as

$$\int_{0}^{\infty}\!{\rm d}s\,{\rm e}^{-\beta s^{2}}\,|{\rm FZ}{\rm T}^{(b)}(s)\rangle\,\,\,.\tag{8.2}$$

Heuristically, since s labels the Liouville momentum of an open string stretched between FZZT and ZZ branes, we think of s 2 as an energy and the Laplace transform as implementing the change to an ensemble of fixed β.

Having fixed the renormalized boundary length with FZZT-like boundary conditions on the spacelike Liouville theory, fixing the asymptotic value of the dilaton as usual in dilaton gravity requires ZZ-like (Dirichlet) boundary conditions for the timelike Liouville theory. Indeed, any of the "half-ZZ" boundary conditions described in section 3.2 is sufficient, when paired with a suitable modification of the FZZT BCFT data for the spacelike Liouville CFT. Following previous literature on Liouville gravity (although our prescription varies significantly in the details, see e.g. [38]), we think of the resulting combined boundary condition as introducing a "marked" disk in Virasoro minimal string theory. The idea is that in string theory equipped with worldsheet boundaries one computes partition functions on unmarked disks, in the sense that translations along the boundary circle are gauged (there is no marked reference point). To undo the effect of the gauging, one should multiply by the volume of translations along the boundary. This is how we interpret the necessary modification of the FZZT boundary state to be described presently.

For example, suppose we equip the timelike Liouville theory with (m, ±) "half-ZZ" boundary conditions. Then we claim that the FZZT boundary conditions on the spacelike Liouville theory should be modified so that the disk one-point function is given by

$$\Psi^{(b)}(s;P)\rightarrow\Psi^{(b)}_{(m,\pm)}(s;P)\equiv\frac{P\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)}{\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi m b^{\pm1}P)}\Psi^{(b)}(s;P)\;,\tag{8.3}$$

where the unmarked one-point function Ψ(b) is given in (3.32). This redefinition is independent of the FZZT brane parameter s so the transformation to the fixed-length basis is unaffected.

To summarize, we claim that the worldsheet boundary conditions that introduce an asymptotic boundary of fixed renormalized length β involve combining the Laplace transform of the marked FZZT boundary conditions for spacelike Liouville CFT with the corresponding half-ZZ boundary conditions for timelike Liouville CFT:

$$\int_{0}^{\infty}\!{\rm d}s\,{\rm e}^{-\beta s^{2}}\,|{\rm FZZ}\Gamma^{(b)}_{(m,\pm)}(s)\rangle\otimes|\widehat{Z}\widehat{Z}^{(ib)}_{(m,\pm)}\rangle\;\;,\tag{8.4}$$

where the subscript on the FZZT boundary state indicates the marking. In what follows we will see that all choices of (m, ±) are in a sense BRST-equivalent.

We note that both the transformation from the fixed-s to the fixed-length basis (8.2) and the marking prescription (8.3) differ substantially from the conventions adopted in previous work on the minimal string. Nevertheless, we will see that the combined BCFTs define the correct conformal boundary conditions that match with the matrix integral.

In particular, the energy in the dual matrix model will be identified with s 2 instead of cosh(2πbs) as is the case e.g. in the minimal string. In those cases, this relation can be motivated from the path integral, but we do not have a sufficiently good understanding of the boundary conditions of timelike Liouville theory to perform such a derivation here. Instead, we remark that the identification of the energy with s 2 is uniquely fixed by requiring that the density of states computed from the disk partition function matches with the spectral curve given in eq. (5.15). We also remark that this identification is quite natural in this context given that from the definition of the FZZT parameter in (3.31) s 2 is the conformal weight in the open-string channel, which is the energy in the Virasoro algebra.

Punctured disk diagram: the trumpet and the disk. We start by computing the trumpet partition function in Virasoro minimal string theory directly from the worldsheet BCFT. The starting point for this computation is the punctured disk diagram, with FZZT boundary conditions on the spacelike Liouville sector and (say) (m, ±) half-ZZ boundary conditions on the timelike Liouville sector. Figure 16 summarizes the relationship between the punctured disk diagram and the trumpet partition function in Virasoro minimal string theory. Taking into account the prescription (8.3), the marked disk diagram is given by the following product of disk one-point functions

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm dik}(s;P)=\widetilde{C}_{\rm D^{2}}{\rm N}\Psi^{(b)}_{(m,\pm)}(s;P)\widetilde{\Psi}^{(ib)}_{(m,\pm)}(P)\tag{8.5}$$ $$=\widetilde{C}_{\rm D^{2}}{\rm N}\,\frac{P\rho^{(b)}_{0}(P)}{\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi mb^{\pm1}P)}\frac{2\sqrt{2}\cos(4\pi sP)}{\rho^{(b)}_{0}(P)}\frac{4\sinh(2\pi mb^{\pm1}P)}{P}$$ $$=2\sqrt{2}\widetilde{C}_{\rm D^{2}}{\rm N}\times2\sqrt{2}\cos(4\pi sP)\,$$

Figure 16: The Laplace transform of the (marked) disk one-point diagram of an on-shell vertex operator VP subject to FZZT(s) boundary conditions in the spacelike Liouville sector and half-ZZ boundary conditions in the timelike Liouville sector of the Virasoro minimal string theory computes the partition function of a "trumpet" with Liouville momentum P and an asymptotic boundary of renormalized length β.

where Ψb(iˆb) (m,±) is given in (3.36) and we used (2.5) and (2.6). Here, Ce D2 is the normalization of the string theory path integral; the tilde indicates that it also includes the volume of the residual U(1) automorphism group of the punctured disk. Equation (8.5) is equivalent to the modular S matrix that decomposes a Virasoro character with Liouville momentum s into a complete basis of characters in the dual channel with Liouville momenta P.

The trumpet partition function, with an asymptotic boundary of renormalized length β, is then given by the Laplace transform (8.2) of the marked disk one-point function (8.5):

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm trumpet}(\beta;P)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!{\rm d}s\,{\rm e}^{-\beta s^{2}}Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(s;P)=2\sqrt{2}\widetilde{C}_{\rm D^{2}}{\rm N}\times\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\beta}}\,{\rm e}^{-\frac{4\pi^{2}p^{2}}{\beta}}.\tag{8.6}$$

As explained in sections 2.5 and 4.4, this should be nothing but the Virasoro character of a primary of conformal weight hP in the dual channel (with modulus τ = 2πi β ) with the contributions of the descendants stripped off. This fixes the normalization

$$\widetilde{C}_{\rm D^{2}}=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}{\rm N}}=\frac{\pi^{2}}{8\sqrt{2}}\,\tag{8.7}$$

where we used that N is given by (7.9). We can then recognize that

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm trumpet}(\beta;P)=\eta\left(\frac{i\beta}{2\pi}\right)\chi^{(b)}_{P}\left(\frac{2\pi i}{\beta}\right).\tag{8.8}$$

This is because the partition function of the Virasoro minimal string on the disk is equivalent to that of (the chiral half of) 3d gravity on the solid cylinder, which computes the corresponding Virasoro character. We get the character in the dual channel because the length of the thermal circle in 3d gravity is related to the length of the boundary disk by a modular S transformation, see section 4.4. Up to an overall scale factor, this is actually equivalent to the trumpet partition function of JT gravity for all values of b (where P is related to the geodesic length as in (2.22) and the inverse temperature is rescaled as in (2.23)).

The empty disk diagram. To compute the empty disk diagram in Virasoro minimal string theory, and hence the disk partition function, we appeal to the dilaton equation (4.15a). The dilaton equation implies that the empty (marked) disk diagram is given by the following difference of punctured disk diagrams

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(s;P=\frac{iQ}{2})-Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(s;P=\frac{i\hat{Q}}{2})=\rho^{(b)}_{0}(s).\tag{8.9}$$

Thus the disk partition function in Virasoro minimal string theory is given by

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(\beta)=\int_{0}^{\infty}{\rm d}s\ {\rm e}^{-\beta s^{2}}\rho^{(b)}_{0}(s)=\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\beta}}\left({\rm e}^{\frac{s^{2}\phi^{2}}{\beta}}-{\rm e}^{\frac{s^{2}\phi^{2}}{\beta}}\right)=\eta\left(\frac{i\beta}{2\pi}\right)\chi^{(b)}_{(1,1)}\left(\frac{2\pi i}{\beta}\right).\tag{8.10}$$

As indicated in the last line, this is equivalent to the Virasoro vacuum character in the dual channel with the descendant-counting eta function stripped off.

Figure 17: The Laplace transform of the cylinder diagram in Virasoro minimal string theory with FZZT(s1) and FZZT(s2) boundary conditions together with half-ZZ boundary conditions on the two ends computes the partition function on the double-trumpet, with asymptotic boundaries of renormalized lengths β1 and β2.

Cylinder diagram: the double-trumpet. We now discuss the computation of the double-trumpet partition function from the worldsheet in Virasoro minimal string theory. We start by considering the cylinder diagram with (s1, s2) FZZT boundary conditions on the spacelike Liouville theory and any combination of half-ZZ boundary conditions on the timelike Liouville theory, subject to the marking prescription (8.3). For concreteness in what follows we will put (m, +) and (n, +) half-ZZ boundary conditions on the timelike Liouville CFT, but we emphasize that the analysis for any other combination proceeds similarly. The relationship between the cylinder diagram and the double-trumpet partition function is recapitulated in figure 17. The (marked) cylinder diagram is computed as the following integral of the cylinder partition functions of the ghost, spacelike Liouville and timelike Liouville CFTs over the modulus t 21

Z (b) cylinder(s1, s2) = Z ∞ 0 dt η(it) 2 Z ∞ 0 dP ρ(b) 0 (P) Ψ(b) (m,+)(s1; P)Ψ(b) (n,+)(s2; P)χ (b) P (it)Z (ib) (m,+;n,+)(t) = √ 2 Z ∞ 0 dt Z ∞ 0 dP η(it) 2 cos(4πs1P) cos(4πs2P) sinh(2πbP) sinh(2πb−1P) χ (b) P (it) × mX +n−1 r 2=|m−n|+1 X∞ s 2=1 χ (ib) (r,s) ( i t ) P ρ(b) 0 (P) √ 2 sinh(2πmbP) ! P ρ(b) 0 (P) √ 2 sinh(2πnbP) ! , (8.11)

where Z (ib) (m,+;n,+) is given in (3.37). We then exchange the integral over the cylinder modulus with that over the Liouville momentum P and use the following identity22

$$\sum_{r\geq|m-n|+1}^{m+n-1}\sum_{s\geq1}^{\infty}\int_{0}^{\infty}\!{\rm d}t\,\eta(it)^{2}\chi_{P}^{(b)}(it)\chi_{(r,s)}^{(b)}(\frac{i}{t})=\frac{\sinh(2\pi nb|P|)\sinh(2\pi nb|P|)}{\sqrt{2}|P|\sinh(2\pi b|P|)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}|P|)}\,\tag{8.12}$$

where the characters are defined in (3.25) and (3.27) respectively. We then arrive at the following simple expression for the cylinder diagram

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm cylinder}(s_{1},s_{2})=\int_{0}^{\infty}(2P\,{\rm d}P)\left(2\sqrt{2}\cos(4\pi s_{1}P)\right)\times\left(2\sqrt{2}\cos(4\pi s_{2}P)\right)\,.\tag{8.13}$$

Notice that this is entirely independent of b. This universality is expected given the duality with the double-scaled matrix integral. Indeed, although formally divergent as written, it is as expected simply the result of gluing two punctured disk diagrams (corresponding to trumpet partition functions in the fixed-length basis) together with the measure 2P dP. This also justifies our marking procedure given by (8.3). A similar calculation leads to the same result for the (m, +; n, −) and (m, −; n, −) assignment of half-ZZ boundary conditions for the timelike Liouville sector.

<sup>21</sup>Here we consider a cylinder of length πt and unit radius. We should also note that there is no counterterm on the annulus since it admits a flat metric. Thus there is no need to introduce a further arbitrary normalization CA2 .

<sup>22</sup>In arriving at this identity we have implicitly assumed that b 2 < 1 m−n+1 . For n = m this is always satisfied for the relevant values of the central charge.

The double-trumpet partition function Z (b) 0,2 in Virasoro minimal string theory is computed by transforming the marked cylinder diagram (8.11) to the fixed-length basis via the Laplace transform (8.2). We find the following universal result

$$Z^{(b)}_{0,2}(\beta_{1},\beta_{2})=\int_{0}^{\infty}\!{\rm d}s_{1}\int_{0}^{\infty}\!{\rm d}s_{2}\,{\rm e}^{-\beta_{1}s_{1}^{2}-\beta_{2}s_{2}^{2}}Z^{(b)}_{\rm cylinder}(s_{1},s_{2})\tag{8.14}$$ $$=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\beta_{1}\beta_{2}}}\int_{0}^{\infty}(2P\,{\rm d}P)\,{\rm e}^{-4\pi^{2}P^{2}\left(\frac{1}{\beta_{1}}+\frac{1}{\beta_{2}}\right)}=\frac{\sqrt{\beta_{1}\beta_{2}}}{2\pi(\beta_{1}+\beta_{2})}\.$$

This is of course equivalent to the result of gluing two trumpet partition functions according to (2.18).

Let us remark that the final results in this section are always independent in the end of the choice of (m, ±) for the half-ZZ boundary condition in the timelike Liouville sector. We take this to mean that these boundary conditions, while different in the worldsheet theory, are equivalent in the full string theory, i.e. after taking the BRST cohomology on the worldsheet. For the case of the minimal string, a similar phenomenon occurs [30].

### 8.2 ZZ-instantons on the worldsheet

We now turn our attention towards the computation of non-perturbative corrections to the partition function.23 As anticipated in section 6.1 from the matrix integral, they are given by ZZ-instantons on the worldsheet. We shall discuss the case b ̸= 1, since the case b = 1 has further zero-modes and is much more subtle.

We shall start by discussing the appropriate boundary conditions for such ZZ-instantons. The boundary condition should not involve any continuous parameters and thus the most general choice is to take the direct product of boundary states

$${\rm ZZ}^{(b)}_{(m,n)}\rangle\otimes|\widehat{\rm ZZ}^{(ib)}_{(k,\pm)}\rangle\ \,\tag{8.15}$$

which were introduced in section 3.2. We shall later restrict attention to a subset of these.

The quantum volume V (b) g,n(P1, . . . , Pn) receives non-perturbative corrections of order exp(−e S0 ) from each ZZ-instanton boundary condition, which themselves admit a perturbative expansion schematically of the form

$$\exp\left(\bigodot+\bigodot+\bigodot\bigodot+\bigodot\bigodot+\cdots\right)$$

<sup>23</sup>This matching of the leading non-perturbative effects in the Virasoro matrix integral to those of half-ZZ instantons on the string worldsheet has been independently observed by [135].

$$\times\left[\left(\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[height=36.135pt]{0.0pt}\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[height=36.135pt]{0.0pt}\end{array}\right)\cdot\left(\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[height=36.135pt]{0.0pt}\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[height=36.135pt]{0.0pt}\end{array}\right)\cdot\left(\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[height=36.135pt]{0.0pt}\end{array}\right)+\cdots\right].\tag{8.16}$$

All boundaries of the diagram end on the same ZZ-instanton boundary conditions labelled by (m, n) and (k, ±). We will focus our attention to the leading non-perturbative correction. Counting powers of the string coupling according to the Euler characteristic, only the disk and cylinder diagram contribute to this order in the exponential, while we also only keep the product of n once-punctured disk diagrams. Thus to leading order, the non-perturbative correction reads

exp + · · · . (8.17)

We will thus discuss the computation of the punctured disk diagram and the cylinder diagram in the following. The empty disk diagram can be obtained from the punctured disk diagram by resorting to the dilaton equation as in section 8.1.

The punctured disk. As in section 8.1, the punctured disk is given by the product of the wavefunctions,

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(m,n,k,\pm;P)=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\,\Psi^{(b)}_{(m,n)}(P)\,\widehat{\Psi}^{(ib)}_{(k,\pm)}(iP)\tag{8.18}$$ $$=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\,\frac{4\sinh(2\pi mbP)\sinh(2\pi nb^{-1}P)\sinh(2\pi kb^{\pm1}P)}{\sinh(2\pi bP)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}P)\,P}\;.$$

The factor of 1 2 √ 2 comes from the normalization of the disk partition function as in (8.5), which we determined in (8.7) to be Ce D2N = 1 2 √ 2 . Thus there is no parameter left in this subsection to adjust.

Notice that this is a redundant basis of boundary conditions. We have for example

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(m,1,k,+;P)=\sum_{r^{\frac{2}{m}|m-k|+1}}^{m+k-1}Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(1,1,r,+;P).\tag{8.19}$$

Similar to [30], we take this as an indication that in the full string theory, these boundary conditions are actually BRST equivalent to each other. In particular, this motivates us to restrict to the (1, 1) ZZ boundary condition in the spacelike Liouville theory.24 For these,

<sup>24</sup>However it seems that not all boundary conditions parametrized by m, n, k, ± can be reduced to this case in a simple way, but only boundary conditions with m = n = 1 seem to be present in the matrix integral, at least at the level of single-instanton calculus considered in this paper. A similar result was observed in the analysis of multi-instanton effects in c = 1 string theory of [9]. There, only the class of ZZ-instantons of type (m, 1) gave a non-vanishing contribution to string S-matrix elements, as deduced by matching to the dual c = 1 matrix quantum mechanics.

we get the simpler answer

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(k,\pm;P)\equiv Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(1,1,k,\pm;P)=\frac{\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi kb^{\pm1}P)}{P}.\tag{8.20}$$

To obtain the empty disk diagram, we apply the dilaton equation as in (8.9) and obtain

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(k,\pm)=Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(k,\pm;P=\frac{iQ}{2})-Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(k,\pm;P=\frac{iQ}{2})\tag{8.21}$$ $$=2\sqrt{2}\left(\frac{\sin(\pi b^{\pm1}kQ)}{Q}-\frac{\sin(\pi b^{\pm1}k\tilde{Q})}{\tilde{Q}}\right)$$ $$=\frac{4\sqrt{2}\left(-1\right)^{k}b^{\pm1}\sin(\pi kb^{\pm2})}{1-b^{\pm4}}\.$$

The cylinder diagram. We can similarly compute the string cylinder diagram associated to the (k, ±) ZZ-instanton. We already computed the cylinder partition function of timelike Liouville theory with two (k, ±) boundaries on both sides in (3.37). Let us focus on the '+'-case, for which we have

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm cyl}(k,+)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{{\rm d}t}{2}\,\eta(it)^{2}\chi^{(b)}_{(1,1)}(\frac{i}{t})\sum_{r\stackrel{{\geq}}{{=}}1}^{2k-1}\sum_{s\stackrel{{\geq}}{{=}}1}^{\infty}\chi^{(ib)}_{(r,s)}(\frac{i}{t})\tag{8.22}$$ $$=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{{\rm d}t}{2t}\,\eta(it)^{2}\chi^{(b)}_{(1,1)}(it)\sum_{r\stackrel{{\geq}}{{=}}1}^{2k-1}\sum_{s\stackrel{{\geq}}{{=}}1}^{\infty}\chi^{(ib)}_{(r,s)}(it)\,$$

where we mapped t → 1 t in the second line. The ingredients are similar to (8.11): the integral over t integrates over the width of the cylinder, η(it) 2 is the ghost partition function and the factor 1 2 originates from the Z2-symmetry that exchanges the two boundaries. The volume of the U(1) automorphism group of the cylinder is 1 in these conventions.

We will continue to work with the representation in the second line of (8.22). The integral is convergent in the region t → 0, which becomes obvious when writing it as

$$Z^{(b)}_{cyl}(k,+)\!=\!\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{{\rm d}t}{2t}\,(1-{\rm e}^{-2\pi t})\sum_{r\stackrel{{\lambda}}{{=}}1}^{2k-1}\sum_{s\stackrel{{\lambda}}{{=}}1}^{\infty}{\rm e}^{-\frac{\pi t}{2t}((r-1)b-(s+1)b^{-1})((r+1)b-(s-1)b^{-1})}(1-{\rm e}^{-2\pi rst})\,\tag{8.23}$$

since the infinite sum over s is absolutely convergent and the factor (1 − e −2πt) vanishes for t → 0. However, the integral is divergent in the region t → ∞ and this divergence is somewhat subtle. One can make sense of this integral using string field theory, as was explained in [60] for the case of the ordinary minimal string. Let us review the argument. Consider first a single term

$$\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{{\rm d}t}{2t}\,{\rm e}^{-\frac{\pi t}{2}((r-1)b-(s+1)b^{-1})((r+1)b-(s-1)b^{-1})}(1-{\rm e}^{-2\pi t})(1-{\rm e}^{-2\pi rest}).\tag{8.24}$$

Assuming that the integral is convergent, i.e.

$$((r-1)b-(s+1)b^{-1})((r+1)b-(s-1)b^{-1})>0\,\tag{8.25}$$

the integral over t converges and can be evaluated to

$$\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{{\rm d}t}{2t}\,{\rm e}^{-\frac{nt}{2}((r-1)b-(s+1)b^{-1})((r+1)b-(s-1)b^{-1})}(1-{\rm e}^{-2rt})(1-{\rm e}^{-2rt})$$ $$=\frac{1}{2}\log\left(\frac{((r-1)b\pm(s-1)b^{-1})((r+1)b\pm(s+1)b^{-1})}{((r-1)b\pm(s+1)b^{-1})((r+1)b\pm(s-1)b^{-1})}\right)\,\tag{8.26}$$

where we take the product over both choices of sign in the logarithm. Within string field theory, this formula is also taken to be valid when the argument of the exponential is positive. However, in that case the argument of the logarithm might be negative and hence the branch is ambiguous. Different branches correspond to different definitions of the integration contour in the string field space.

Assuming that b 2 ̸∈ Q, this deals with all cases (r, s) ̸= (1, 1), where the argument of the logarithm is non-singular. In the case (r, s) = (1, 1), we should compute the integral

$$\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{{\rm d}t}{2t}\left({\rm e}^{2\pi t}-2+{\rm e}^{-2\pi t}\right)\,,\tag{8.27}$$

which of course diverges badly and cannot be rendered finite by contour deformation. The origin of this divergence is a breakdown of the Siegel gauge-fixing condition. One can instead fix the gauge in a different way as explained by Sen [11]. We will not repeat the full string field theory analysis here, which may be found in [60], but use the result that it leads to the interpretation

$$\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{{\rm d}t}{2t}\left({\rm e}^{2\pi t}-2+{\rm e}^{-2\pi t}\right)=-\frac{1}{2}\log\left(\,-\,2^{5}\pi^{3}T_{k,+}^{(b)}\right)\,.\tag{8.28}$$

Here, (T (b) k,+ ) − 1 2 is the instanton action as computed by the empty disk diagram, T (b) k,+ = −Z (b) disk(k, +). Again, the choice of branch cut in the logarithm is ambiguous.

Putting together the ingredients, we hence find

$$Z_{\rm cyl}(k_{+})=-\frac{1}{2}\log\big{(}-2^{5}\pi^{3}T^{(b)}_{k_{+}}\big{)}\tag{8.29}$$ $$+\frac{1}{2}\log\left(\prod_{r,\frac{2}{(r,b)\pi}\atop r\in[k,1]}^{2k-1}\prod_{r,\frac{2}{(r,b)\pi}\atop r\in[k,1]}^{\infty}\frac{((r-1)b\pm(s-1)b^{-1})((r+1)b\pm(s+1)b^{-1})}{((r-1)b\pm(s+1)b^{-1})((r+1)b\pm(s-1)b^{-1})}\right)$$ $$=-\frac{1}{2}\log\big{(}-2^{5}\pi^{3}T^{(b)}_{k_{+}}(1-b^{4})k^{2}\big{)}\,$$

where we used that the infinite product telescopes.

The leading ZZ-instanton correction to the quantum volumes. It is now simple to compute the leading ZZ-instanton correction to the resummed quantum volumes (2.8). The leading ZZ-instanton correction takes the form

$$\mathsf{V}_{n}^{(b)}(S_{0};P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})_{k,\pm}^{[1]}=\exp\left(\mathrm{e}^{S_{0}}Z_{\mathrm{disk}}^{(b)}(k,\pm)+Z_{\mathrm{cyl}}^{(b)}(k,\pm)\right)\prod_{j=1}^{n}Z_{\mathrm{abs}}^{(b)}(k,\pm;P_{j})\tag{8.30}$$ $$=\frac{i\,\mathrm{e}^{-T_{\pm,\pm}^{(b)}}}{2^{\frac{1}{2}}\pi^{\frac{1}{2}}(T_{k,\pm}^{(b)})^{\frac{1}{2}}(1-b^{\pm4})^{\frac{1}{2}}k\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi b^{\pm1}P_{j})}{P_{j}}\,$$

with

$$T^{(b)}_{k,\pm}=\frac{4\sqrt{2}\,{\rm e}^{S_{0}}b^{\pm1}(-1)^{k+1}\sin(\pi kb^{\pm2})}{1-b^{\pm4}}\,\tag{8.31}$$

which matches with the value computed in the matrix model (6.10). In both formulas, the sign is ambiguous. Overall, we hence precisely reproduce (6.12), giving strong evidence for the proposal even at the non-perturbative level.

# Part IV Discussion

## 9 Loose ends

Let us mention some further applications of our duality and some loose ends.

Positivity of the volumes. For b ∈ R, i.e. c ≥ 25 and Pj ∈ R, the quantum volumes are all positive, as is appropriate for "volumes". This is obvious from the worldsheet definition (2.7). Indeed, all the OPE data and conformal blocks are positive so that the integrand is positive. Hence also the volumes are positive.

In fact, something stronger is true. Writing the volumes as a Laurent polynomial in b 2 and a polynomial in the momenta Pj , all non-zero coefficients of the polynomial are positive. This follows directly recursively from the deformed Mirzakhani recursion (2.13). Indeed, all terms in the recursion come with a plus sign and all the coefficients in the basic integrals (5.37) are strictly positive. Together with the correctness of the statement for the initial conditions, the recursion proves this statement.

If we however leave the regime c ≥ 25, then positivity of the volumes no longer holds. For large enough genus, the asymptotic formula (6.20) implies that the quantum volumes V (b) g,0 have a zero near c = 25 and one can directly check that such a zero exists in explicit examples. For example, all the zeros of V (b) 12,0 lie in the interval c ∈ [1, 25], the maximal of which is c ≈ 24.0046.

Dilaton equation of timelike Liouville theory. The duality discussed in this paper has an interesting consequence purely within CFT. The path integral of timelike Liouville induced from the action (2.3b) suggests that the operator e2bχ is an exactly marginal operator, just like in spacelike Liouville theory. It should merely change the value of the cosmological constant µtL. From KPZ scaling [136], µtL appears in correlation functions of both types of Liouville theory as a universal prefactor raised to the Euler characteristic. The marginal operator becomes Vb hˆ=1 in the quantum theory, where by a slight abuse of notation we label the operator by its conformal weight rather than its Liouville momentum. Hence the path integral formulation of the theory suggests that

$$\int{\rm d}^{2}z\,\left\langle\widehat{V}_{\hat{h}=1}(z)\prod_{j=1}^{n}\widehat{V}_{\hat{P}_{j}}(z_{j})\right\rangle_{g}\stackrel{{?}}{{\propto}}(2g-2+n)\left\langle\prod_{j=1}^{n}\widehat{V}_{\hat{P}_{j}}(z_{j})\right\rangle_{g}\,.\tag{9.1}$$

However, this equation turns out to need refinement. The problem is that the field Vb hˆ=1(z) has singular correlation functions because the structure constant of timelike Liouville theory has a simple pole at hˆ = 1 (i.e. Pb = 1 2 (b + b −1 )). We can define a residue field Reshˆ=1 Vb hˆ (z) whose correlation functions are given by the residue of the timelike Liouville correlation functions at hˆ = 1. However, the field Reshˆ=1 Vb hˆ (z) has special properties. It satisfies

$$\begin{array}{l}{{\rm Res}\,\widehat{V}_{\hat{h}}(z)=-\frac{1}{2}\partial\bar{\partial}\widehat{V}_{\hat{h}=0}(z)\.}\end{array}\tag{9.2}$$

Here, the field appearing on the right-hand-side is the unique primary field of conformal dimension 0 in the spectrum of timelike Liouville theory. As was discussed in the literature [56], and summarized in section 3.1, this field is however not the identity operator and in particular its derivative does not vanish. (9.2) is the analogue of the first higher equation of motion of spacelike Liouville theory [137]. It can easily be checked at the level of the three-point functions, which then ensures that (9.2) holds in any correlation function by conformal symmetry. In particular (9.2) implies that

$$\int{\rm d}^{2}z\,\left\langle\,{\rm Res}\,\widehat{V}_{h}(z)\prod_{j=1}^{n}\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{j}}(z_{j})\right\rangle_{g}=0\,\,,\tag{9.3}$$

instead of (9.1).

However, one can derive the correct version of the dilaton equation in timelike Liouville theory from the dilaton equation of the quantum volumes (4.15a). Since it holds for arbitrary operator insertions on the worldsheet, we can remove most of the integrals on the worldsheet in (4.15a) and get an equation where we only integrate over the location of the (n + 1)-st marked point on the LHS. We set for simplicity n = 0, since the other vertex operators are only spectators. We denote the partition functions by an empty correlation function ⟨1⟩g and ⟨b1⟩g, respectively. We get

(2g − 2)⟨1⟩g⟨b1⟩g = lim h→1 Z d 2 z ⟨Vh(z)⟩g⟨Vb1−h(z)⟩g − lim h→0 Z d 2 z ⟨Vh(z)⟩g⟨Vb1−h(z)⟩g = Z d 2 z ⟨V1(z)⟩g⟨Vb0(z)⟩g − lim h→0 − 1 h Z d 2 z ⟨1⟩g Res hˆ=1 Vb hˆ (z) g − Z d 2 z ⟨V ′ 0 (z)⟩g Res hˆ=1 Vb hˆ (z) + Z d 2 z ⟨1⟩g Vbren 1 (z) g = 1 2 Z d 2 z ⟨∂ ¯∂V ′ 0 (z) − 1 4R⟩g⟨Vb0(z)⟩g − ⟨V ′ 0 (z)⟩g⟨∂ ¯∂Vb0(z)⟩g − ⟨1⟩g Z d 2 z Vbren 1 (z) g = −⟨1⟩g Z d 2 z Vbren 1 (z) + 1 8RVb0(z) g . (9.4)

In going from the first to the second line, we Laurent expanded the second term. Here we used the notation

$$\widehat{V}_{1}^{\rm ren}(z)\equiv\lim_{\hat{h}\to1}\left[\widehat{V}_{\hat{h}}(z)-\frac{1}{\hat{h}-1}\mathop{\rm Res}_{\hat{h}=1}\widehat{V}_{\hat{h}}(z)\right]\,.\tag{9.5}$$

We also used the first higher equation of motion of ordinary Liouville theory,

$$V_{1}(z)=\frac{1}{2}\partial\bar{\partial}V^{\prime}_{0}-\frac{1}{8}{\cal R}\,\tag{9.6}$$

where ′ denotes a derivative in the conformal weight and R is the Ricci curvature. The combination

$$\Phi(z)=-\widehat{V}_{1}^{\rm ren}(z)-\frac{1}{8}{\cal R}\widehat{V}_{0}(z)\tag{9.7}$$

does indeed transform like a primary field of conformal weight 1, up to an inhomogeneous term that is a total derivative. We used integration by parts to cancel the two terms in the fourth line of (9.4). We thus learn that

$$\int{\rm d}^{2}z\,\left\langle\Phi(z)\prod_{j=1}^{n}\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{j}}(z_{j})\right\rangle_{g}=(2g-2+n)\left\langle\prod_{j=1}^{n}\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{j}}(z_{j})\right\rangle_{g}\,,\tag{9.8}$$

which is the correct version of (9.1). We did not manage to prove this equation directly in conformal field theory, but it is an interesting prediction of the present duality.

Defect regime. In the worldsheet description of the Virasoro minimal string (section 7), we took physical vertex operators to have Pj ∈ R, i.e. the external spacelike Liouville momentum was real and the timelike Liouville momentum was imaginary. This can of course be relaxed and we can consider general complex momenta Pj , which should still give rise to the quantum volumes V (b) g,n(P1, . . . , Pn), but with complex values of the Liouville momenta. Let us reiterate however that the worldsheet moduli integrand can change non-smoothly when the external momenta Pj are complexified. In particular, whenever there is a pair of momenta Pj , Pk such that |Im(Pj ± Pk)| > Q 2 , the spacelike Liouville CFT correlator may pick up additional contributions from sub-threshold states in particular OPE channels. These contributions can affect the convergence of the moduli integral and may require regularization. In these situations the string diagrams are presumably not simply the analytic continuation of the corresponding quantum volumes.

Given the relation of the Virasoro minimal string and JT gravity, one may expect that taking Pj imaginary is related to the Weil-Petersson volumes of surfaces with conical defects as studied in [39, 50, 52, 54, 138]. Indeed, at least for sufficiently "sharp" defects, the corresponding Weil-Petersson volumes are simply obtained from the ordinary Weil-Petersson volumes by inserting purely imaginary values of the geodesic lengths. However, there is a subtlety. This prescription is only correct when the defects are sufficiently sharp; for blunter defects the Weil-Petersson volume changes in a non-analytic way. This mirrors the situation on the worldsheet described in the previous paragraph.

Witten's deformations of JT gravity. Witten proposed a duality between a large class of dilaton gravities and Hermitian matrix models [50]. The dilaton potentials in that duality are of the form

$$W(\Phi)=2\Phi+2\sum_{i=1}^{r}\varepsilon_{i}\,{\rm e}^{-\alpha_{i}\Phi}\tag{9.9}$$

with π < αi < 2π. For P i εi = 0, this class of dilaton gravities is described by a dual matrix model with leading density of states

$$\varrho_{0}(E)=\frac{{\rm e}^{2\pi\sqrt{E}}W(\sqrt{E})+{\rm e}^{-2\pi\sqrt{E}}W(-\sqrt{E})}{8\pi\sqrt{E}}.\tag{9.10}$$

This formula is derived by deforming JT gravity by a gas of defects. Let us emphasize that the potential of the Virasoro minimal string is not of this form. Nevertheless, when plugging the sinh-dilaton potential given in eq. (2.1) into (9.9), one recovers the correct density of states of the Virasoro matrix integral (up to a rescaling of the energy). This gives some evidence that the equations of [50] hold beyond the assumptions stated above.

Tau-scaling limit and cancellations in the quantum volumes. Some interesting recent works [139–141] have investigated the perturbative sum over higher-genus contributions to the spectral form factor

$${\rm SFF}(T)=\sum_{g=0}^{\infty}{\rm e}^{-2gS_{0}}\,{\rm SFF}_{g}(T)=\sum_{g=0}^{\infty}{\rm e}^{-2gS_{0}}Z_{g,n=2}(\beta+iT,\beta-iT)\tag{9.11}$$

of double-scaled matrix models and dilaton gravity models in the so-called "tau-scaling" limit, which is a late-time T → ∞ limit with T e −S0 fixed. The linear growth of SFFg=0(T) at late times (the "ramp") is a universal feature of double-scaled matrix integrals, but these works argued that in the tau-scaling limit the full sum over genera in fact has a finite radius of convergence, providing perturbative access to the late time plateau of the spectral form factor. A key to this convergence is the fact that the genus-g contribution to the spectral form factor only grows as ∼ T 2g+1 at late times, rather than the expected T 3g−1 . This slower growth is facilitated by novel cancellations due to the underlying integrable structure of the theory; in JT gravity these correspond to cancellations in the series expansion of the Weil-Petersson volumes in terms of the two geodesic lengths. In Virasoro minimal string theory, the quantum volumes V (b) g,2 exhibit the exact same cancellations. Adapting the notation of [139] for the Weil-Petersson volumes, if one expands the quantum volumes as

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,2}(P_{1},P_{2})=\sum_{d_{1},d_{2}=0}^{d_{1}+d_{2}=3g-1}\frac{(4\pi^{2})^{d_{1}}(4\pi^{2})^{d_{2}}}{d_{1}!d_{2}!}{\sf v}^{(b)}_{g,d_{1},d_{2}}P_{1}^{2d_{1}}P_{2}^{2d_{2}}\,\tag{9.12}$$

with some coefficients v (b) g,d1,d2 , then the genus-g contribution to the spectral form factor is given by gluing trumpets as in (2.18)

$$Z_{g,n=2}(\beta_{1},\beta_{2})=\sum_{d_{1},d_{2}=0}^{d_{1}+d_{2}=3g-1}\frac{\nu_{g,d_{1},d_{2}}^{(b)}}{8\pi^{3}}\,\beta_{1}^{d_{1}+\frac{1}{2}}\,\beta_{2}^{d_{2}+\frac{1}{2}}\,\tag{9.13}$$

upon analytic continuation to β1 = β + iT, β2 = β − iT. One can indeed verify that25

X 2q d=0 (−1)d v (b) g,d,2q−d = 0, q > g , (9.14)

leading to the expected slower late-time growth of the genus-g contribution to the spectral form factor, SFFg(T) ∼ T 2g+1 .

Near-extremal black holes. Dilaton gravity is often introduced as a universal 2d theory of gravity that describes the physics of near-extremal black holes in higher dimensions. In fact this approach was used recently to successfully compute supersymmetric indices from the gravitational path integral [142–147]. In particular one can engineer also sinh-dilaton gravity from near-extremal limits of higher dimensional black holes.

From the definition, one setup is particularly straightforward. Consider an AdS3/CFT2 correspondence whose dual CFT is assumed to be irrational and with only Virasoro symmetry (as well as a discrete spectrum).26 Then its torus partition function can be written as

$$Z_{\rm CFT}(\tau,\bar{\tau})=\chi_{\rm vac}(\tau)\chi_{\rm vac}(-\bar{\tau})+\sum_{h,\bar{h}>0}a_{h,\bar{h}}\chi_{h}(\tau)\chi_{\bar{h}}(-\bar{\tau})\,\tag{9.15}$$

where ah,h¯ are positive integer degeneracies. One can take the CFT to be Lorentzian which amounts to making τ and ¯τ purely imaginary and independent, i.e. τ = iβ and −τ¯ = iβ¯. One can thus consider the limit β¯ → ∞ with β held fixed. This reduces the CFT partition function to the vacuum character, which is the disk partition function of the Virasoro minimal

<sup>26</sup>Below we actually make the slightly stronger assumption that there is a nonzero gap in the spectrum of twists of non-vacuum Virasoro primaries.

string. In the bulk, such a limit corresponds to a near-extremal limit of the BTZ black hole.27 In particular, we learn that the Virasoro minimal string sits inside any irrational AdS3/CFT2 correspondence as a universal subsector.

Relation to ensemble duality of 3d gravity. The previous paragraph has in particular very concrete ramifications for the holographic dual of pure 3d gravity. It has been conjectured that 3d quantum gravity admits a holographic description in terms of an appropriate notion of an "ensemble of 2d CFTs" or "random 2d CFT" [151], and indeed many aspects of 3d gravity, particularly Euclidean wormhole partition functions, are nontrivially reproduced by statistical averages over 2d CFT data [152, 153]. The precise nature of such an ensemble description remains elusive (but see [154] for recent progress), and many Euclidean wormhole partition functions may instead be interpreted in terms of coarse-graining microscopic data of individual CFTs [155–157]. The Virasoro minimal string now leads to the concrete prediction that the near-extremal limit as defined in the previous paragraph of the random ensemble of 2d CFTs is governed by the Virasoro matrix integral. This in particular lends further credence to the idea that 3d gravity is described holographically via a suitable ensemble of 2d CFTs.

## 10 Future directions

Supersymmetric Virasoro minimal string. A natural extension of the Virasoro minimal string would be to incorporate worldsheet supersymmetry. For N = 1 supersymmetry, spacelike Liouville theory is a unitary superconformal field theory with central charge c ≥ 27 2 . Whereas the structure constants of N = 1 spacelike Liouville theory have been bootstrapped (see e.g. [158–160]), the N = 1 timelike counterpart with ˆc ≤ 3 2 has not been discussed much in the literature (see however [49, 161] for a discussion of supersymmetric timelike Liouville theory from a path integral perspective). The spectrum and structure constants of supersymmetric timelike Liouville theory have not been explored. It would be interesting to understand whether a relation similar to (3.6) exists also in the supersymmetric case.

We expect that the N = 1 supersymmetric Virasoro minimal string, defined as the worldsheet superconformal field theory

$$c\geq\frac{27}{2}\ {\cal N}=1\quad\oplus\quad\hat{c}\leq\frac{3}{2}\ {\cal N}=1\quad\oplus\ {\sf b}{\sf c}\mbox{-ghosts}\ \oplus\ \beta\gamma\mbox{-ghosts}\,\tag{10.1}$$

Liouville CFT $\quad$ Liouville CFT $\quad$

<sup>27</sup>Usually, one considers a combined semiclassical and near-extremal limit in which β¯ ∼ c → ∞ combined with the further limit β ≲ c −1 , where the model reduces to the Schwarzian or JT gravity in the bulk [51,148]. At large c, the validity of this approximation requires a further sparseness assumption on the spectrum of the theory [149, 150].

also admits a dual matrix model description. As explained in [109] for the case of super JT gravity without time reversal symmetry, there are two such theories. On the bulk side, they differ whether we weigh odd spin structures with an opposite sign with respect to even spin structures or not, corresponding to type 0A and 0B GSO projections of (10.1). The former corresponds to a matrix model with odd N and the latter to a matrix model with even N. Both cases can be reduced to a GUE ensemble for the supercharge, see [109, eqs. (2.19) and (2.20)]. For the super Virasoro minimal string, it is natural to conjecture that the leading density of states of the dual matrix integral is given by the following universal density of states in N = 1 SCFT:28

$$\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)=2\sqrt{2}\cosh(\pi bP)\cosh(\pi b^{-1}P)\,\tag{10.2}$$

with the parametrization

$$c=\frac{3}{2}+3Q^{2}\,\ \ Q=b+b^{-1}\,\ \ h_{P}=\frac{c-\frac{3}{2}}{24}+\frac{P^{2}}{2}+\frac{\delta}{16}\tag{10.3}$$

where δ = 0 in the NS-sector and δ = 1 in the R-sector, and P 2 is again identified with the energy of eigenvalues in the matrix integral. In the limit b → 0, this reduces to the density of states of super JT gravity found by Stanford and Witten [109].

One can also consider N = 2 supersymmetry. N = 2 JT gravity was recently analyzed [162] and one can imagine coupling N = 2 spacelike and timelike Liouville together which define a critical N = 2 superstring. N = 2 supersymmetric Liouville theory stands on less firm footing. For c > 3 spacelike Liouville is a unitary superconformal field theory, with its timelike counterpart restricted to the regime c < 3. The spectrum and structure constants for neither theory have been established. However, at least the spacelike structure constants are conjecturally known via the duality to the supersymmetric SL(2, R)/U(1) Kazama–Suzuki supercoset model [163].

Different matrix model statistics. There are three classes of bosonic matrix models, the GUE, GOE or GSE type. In this paper, we discussed Hermitian matrix integrals, which correspond to GUE. In the bulk, this corresponds to only summing over orientable surfaces. It is also possible to consider the other two matrix model statistics, which also involve summing over non-orientable surfaces in the bulk, possibly with a phase (−1)χ(Σ), where χ(Σ) is the Euler characteristic of the surface. This was explored for JT gravity in [109]. Similarly, one can consider the different Altland-Zirnbauer classes of supersymmetric matrix models [164] which are expected to be dual to the different varieties of the supersymmetric Virasoro minimal string.

<sup>28</sup>SC is grateful to Henry Maxfield for discussions explaining this formula.

Two spacelike Liouville theories. In the Virasoro minimal string we combine spacelike Liouville with central charge c ≥ 25 and timelike Liouville theory with central charge 26 −c. Another natural 'minimal string' worldsheet is two coupled spacelike Liouville theories with central charges c+ and c− such that c+ +c− = 26. In particular one can consider any complex central charge c± ∈ C\(−∞, 1]∪[25,∞). This model seems to be more complicated than the Virasoro minimal string because for example the product of two DOZZ structure constants does not cancel out. Thus already the three-point function is non-trivial. The product of two DOZZ structure constants has in fact an elliptic structure with modular parameter τ = b 2 ∈ H [43].

In the special case c± ∈ 13 ± iR, one may suspect a relation to dS3 quantum gravity, which is described by purely imaginary central charge (up to order O(1) corrections) and thus this worldsheet theory seems to be more suitable to describe two-dimensional quantum gravity with a positive cosmological constant.

Non-analytic Virasoro minimal string. There is another variant of the Virasoro minimal string that we might call the non-analytic Virasoro minimal string. To define it, we have to specialize to the rational case b 2 = q p ∈ Q. Then there exists a distinct theory from timelike Liouville theory that we can consider as a matter theory. Its structure constants for real external Pbj are given by [78, 165, 166]

$$\widehat{C}_{\hat{b}}^{\rm non-ana}(\widehat{P}_{1},\widehat{P}_{2},\widehat{P}_{3})=\widehat{C}_{\hat{b}}(\widehat{P}_{1},\widehat{P}_{2},\widehat{P}_{3})\sigma(\widehat{P}_{1},\widehat{P}_{2},\widehat{P}_{3})\,\tag{10.4}$$

where

$$\sigma(\widehat{P}_{1},\widehat{P}_{2},\widehat{P}_{3})=\begin{cases}1\;,&\prod_{\pm,\pm}\sin\pi\big{(}\frac{1}{2}(p-q)+\sqrt{pq}(\widehat{P}_{1}\pm\widehat{P}_{2}\pm\widehat{P}_{3})\big{)}<0\;,\\ 0\;,&\text{else}\;,\end{cases}\tag{10.5}$$

and Cbˆb are the timelike Liouville structure constants discussed in section 3.1. This matter theory is called non-analytic Liouville theory, while for the special case ˆc = 1, it is known as the Runkel-Watts theory. The non-analytic quantum volumes defined by this matter theory are presumably closely related to the quantum volumes V (b) g,n(P1, . . . , Pn). However, since it is not obvious how to extend the structure constants (10.4) to complex values of Pbj , the definition is at least naively restricted to the defect regime with Pj ∈ iR.

Multi-instanton effects and gs-sub-leading contributions. Another interesting direction for future research is to study non-perturbative multi-instanton effects [9, 167, 168]. A general worldsheet instanton configuration with a number of instantons of type (ki , ±i) in the timelike Liouville sector is expected to correspond to the non-perturbative contribution to the Virasoro matrix integral. They stem from a configuration with multiple eigenvalues integrated along the steepest descent contour of the extrema at E ∗ ki,±i . This was recently considered for the minimal string [168]. Furthermore, it would be interesting to study subleading corrections in gs at a given instanton configuration coming from worldsheet diagrams at higher open string loop level, as depicted in (8.16), which would require a more systematic string field theory analysis [14, 20, 169].

Off-shell topologies in 3d gravity. The Virasoro minimal string is presumably also useful to compute certain off-shell partition functions of 3d quantum gravity. While onshell partition functions are by now fully understood [88], it has been argued that especially Seifert manifolds play an important role in the holography of 3d gravity. In particular, it was argued in [51] that they give off-shell contributions to the 3d gravity partition function that save the negativities in the Maloney-Witten partition function [93,170,171] by summing up to a non-perturbative shift of the extremality bound for BTZ black holes. The negativities precisely appear in the near-extremal limit described above and thus the tool to argue for their resolution involved the reduction to JT gravity. The 3d gravity partition function on Seifert manifolds was argued to be related to the JT gravity partition function on a Riemann surface with additional insertions of conical defects at the singular points of the Seifert fibration. The Virasoro minimal string should lead to a precise refinement of this argument and thus it would be interesting to reconsider it in this new light.

Direct derivation of the deformed Mirzakhani recursion. We derived the deformation of Mirzakhani's recursion given by eq. (2.13) in a rather convoluted way by first finding the dual matrix model and then translating its loop equations to the deformed Mirzakhani recursion in the bulk. It would be more satisfying to give a direct derivation of the recursion relation from the worldsheet, much like Mirzakhani managed to use a generalization of McShane's identity [172] to give a direct derivation of the recursion relation [61]. For the minimal string, such a derivation is in principle available, thanks to the existence of higher equations of motions in Liouville theory [137, 173], even though it was so far only applied to low g and n [53, 173–175]. Higher equations of motion do not seem to help for the Virasoro minimal string since the relevant vertex operators are not degenerate. However, it is possible that techniques known from topological string theory can lead to such a direct derivation [176].

Cohomological interpretation of the minimal string. We found a very satisfying realization of the Virasoro minimal string in terms of intersection theory on Mg,n, see eq. (4.12). Such a clear interpretation is to our knowledge not available for the usual minimal string and it would be interesting to find one, thus potentially leading to a more direct understanding of the duality in that case.

# Part V Appendices

## A ψ- and κ-classes

In this appendix, we briefly review the definition of the cohomology ψi- and κm-classes that enter the intersection number formula for the volumes (4.14). We refer e.g. to [177] for more details.

We always consider the cohomology with complex coefficients and will not indicate this always explicitly. One can construct n line bundles L1, . . . ,Ln over Mg,n whose fiber at Σg,n is the cotangent space at the i-th marked point on the surface.29 One can then take the first Chern class of these bundles and obtain the ψ-classes

$\psi_{i}=c_{1}(\mathbb{L}_{i})$.

Topological gravity computes the intersection number of ψ-classes [63]:

$$\int_{\overline{\cal M}_{g,n}}\psi^{d_{1}}_{1}\cdots\psi^{d_{n}}_{n}\,\qquad d_{1}+\cdots+d_{n}=3g-3+n\.$$ (A.2)

For our purposes we also need the so-called κ-classes. Let π : Mg,n+1 −→ Mg,n be the forgetful map that forgets the location of the last marked point. The fiber of this map describes the location of the (n+1)-st marked point and is hence isomorphic to the Riemann surface itself. One can then take a cohomology class in Mg,n+1 and consider the pushforward to Mg,n, which means that we integrate it over the fiber of the map. For α a k-form we have

$$\pi_{*}\alpha=\int_{\Sigma_{g,n}}\alpha\in{\rm H}^{k-2}(\overline{{\cal M}}_{g,n})\.$$ (A.3)

We can then define the Mumford-Morita-Miller classes κm as follows:

$\kappa_{m}=\pi_{*}(\psi^{m+1}_{n+1})$.

Notice that κm is a class in H2m(Mg,n). In fact, all cohomology classes we consider are even cohomology classes and thus commute.

<sup>29</sup>The definition of the line bundle on the boundary of moduli space is a bit subtle and we again refer e.g. to [177] for details.

In particular, κ1 plays a very important role. It is a class in H2 (Mg,n) and is known to represent the cohomology class of the Weil-Petersson form on a surface with cusps [178,179]:

$$\kappa_{1}=\frac{1}{2\pi^{2}}\left[\omega_{\rm WP}(0,\ldots,0)\right]\,.$$ (A.5)

Here, it is important that we consider the Weil-Petersson form on a surface where all the punctures are represented by cusps in the hyperbolic language. If we have a surface with geodesic boundaries, the class of the Weil-Petersson form is instead modified to [96]

$$\omega_{\rm WP}(\ell_{1},\ldots,\ell_{n})]=2\pi^{2}\kappa_{1}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}\ell_{i}^{2}\psi_{i}\.$$ (A.6)

## B List of quantum volumes

Let us present a list of the quantum volumes V (b) g,n as computed by the topological recursion. We borrow the following notation from [180]

$m_{(\ell_{1},...,\ell_{k})}=P_{1}^{2\ell_{1}}P_{2}^{2\ell_{2}}\cdots P_{k}^{2\ell_{k}}+\ \mbox{permutations}\,$ (B.1)

where we sum over all distinct permutations of (ℓ1, ℓ2, . . . , ℓk, 0, . . . , 0) (with n−k additional zeros). For example,

$$m_{(1)}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}P_{j}^{2}\,$$ (B.2a)

$$m_{(1,1)}=\sum_{1\leq j<k\leq n}P_{j}^{2}P_{k}^{2}\ ,$$ (B.2b)

$$m_{(2,1)}=\sum_{j\neq k}^{n}P_{j}^{4}P_{k}^{2}\.$$ (B.2c)

We then have

$${\sf V}_{0,4}^{(b)}=\frac{c-13}{24}+m_{(1)}\,$$ (B.3a)

$${\sf V}_{1,1}^{(0)}=\frac{c-13}{576}+\frac{m_{(1)}}{24}\,$$ (B.3b)

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{0.5}=\frac{5c^{2}-130c+797}{1152}+\frac{c-13}{8}\,m_{(1)}+\frac{m_{(2)}}{2}+2m_{(1,1)}\,$$ (B.3c)

$${\rm V}_{1,2}^{(b)}=\frac{(c-17)(c-9)}{9216}+\frac{c-13}{288}\,m_{(1)}+\frac{m_{(2)}}{48}+\frac{m_{(1,1)}}{24}\,$$ (B.3d)

$$\mathsf{V_{0,6}^{(b)}=\frac{(c-13)(61c^{2}-1586c+9013)}{82944}+\frac{13c^{2}-338c+2101}{576}\,m_{(1)}+\frac{c-13}{8}\,m_{(2)}}$$

## C Liouville CFT compendium

In this appendix we specify the conventions we follow for the three-point coefficients in c ≤ 1 and c ≥ 25 Liouville CFT and list some of their properties, as well as present a brief review of the recursion relations that we employ to compute the sphere four-point and torus one-point Virasoro conformal blocks numerically.

### C.1 Liouville CFT structure constants

In our convention the structure constant for spacelike Liouville theory is given by (3.1)

$$\langle V_{P_{1}}(0)V_{P_{2}}(1)V_{P_{3}}(\infty)\rangle=C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3})\equiv\frac{\Gamma_{b}(2Q)\Gamma_{b}(\frac{Q}{2}\pm iP_{1}\pm iP_{2}\pm iP_{3})}{\sqrt{2}\Gamma_{b}(Q)^{3}\prod_{k=1}^{3}\Gamma_{b}(Q\pm2iP_{k})}\,$$ (C.1)

while the timelike structure constant (3.6) is given by

$$\langle\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{1}}(0)\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{2}}(1)\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{3}}(\infty)\rangle=\widehat{C}_{\hat{k}}(\widehat{P}_{1},\widehat{P}_{2},\widehat{P}_{3})=\frac{\sqrt{2}\Gamma_{\hat{b}}(\hat{b}+\hat{b}^{-1})^{3}\prod_{\hat{k}=1}^{3}\Gamma_{\hat{b}}(\hat{b}+\hat{b}^{-1}\pm2\widehat{P}_{\hat{k}})}{\Gamma_{\hat{b}}(2\hat{b}+2\hat{b}^{-1})\,\Gamma_{\hat{b}}(\frac{b\hat{b}^{k-1}}{2}\pm\widehat{P}_{1}\pm\widehat{P}_{2}\pm\widehat{P}_{3})}\;.$$ (C.2)

Cb(P1, P2, P3) is invariant under reflections Pi → −Pi and under permutations of P1, P2, P3. The same with hatted variables holds true for Cbˆb (Pb1, Pb2, Pb3).

The double Gamma function is a meromorphic function that can be defined as the unique function satisfying the functional equations

$$\Gamma_{b}(z+b)=\frac{\sqrt{2\pi}\,b^{bz-\frac{1}{2}}}{\Gamma(bz)}\,\Gamma_{b}(z)\,\qquad\Gamma_{b}(z+b^{-1})=\frac{\sqrt{2\pi}\,b^{-b^{-1}z+\frac{1}{2}}}{\Gamma(b^{-1}z)}\,\Gamma_{b}(z)\,$$ (C.3)

together with the normalization Γb( Q 2 ) = 1. It admits an explicit integral representation in the half-plane Re(z) > 0.

$$\log\Gamma_{b}(z)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{{\rm d}t}{t}\left(\frac{{\rm e}^{\frac{t}{2}(Q-2z)}-1}{4\sinh(\frac{t}{2})\sinh(\frac{t}{2t})}-\frac{1}{8}\left(Q-2z\right)^{2}{\rm e}^{-t}-\frac{Q-2z}{2t}\right)\.$$ (C.4)

Γb(z) has simple poles for

$z=-(r-1)b-(s-1)b^{-1}$, $r$, $s\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq1}$, (C.5)

and consequently Cb(P1, P2, P3) has

- zeros when Pk = ± i 2 (rb + sb−1 ) , r, s ∈ Z≥1 , k ∈ {1, 2, 3}
- poles when ±P1 ± P2 ± P3 = i(r − 1 2 )b + i(s − 1 2 )b −1 , r, s ∈ Z≥1 .

The zeros are associated to the case where one of the external operators corresponds to a degenerate representation of the Virasoro algebra. On the other hand, the poles are associated with multi-twist operators in non-rational two-dimensional conformal field theory [181,182]. These poles may cross the contour of integration in the OPE of the spacelike Liouville correlator (3.5) when there exists a pair of external operators with |Im(Pi ± Pj )| > Q 2 , leading to additional discrete contributions to the conformal block decomposition. Similarly we find that the timelike structure constant Cbˆb (Pb1, Pb2, Pb3) has

- zeros when ±Pb1 ± Pb2 ± Pb3 = (r − 1 2 ) ˆb + i(s − 1 2 ) ˆb −1 , r, s ∈ Z≥1 .
- poles when Pbk = ± 1 2 (r ˆb + s ˆb −1 ) , r, s ∈ Z≥1 , k ∈ {1, 2, 3} .

Let us note the identity (see [183] for the case m = 2, n = 1)

$$\Gamma_{b}(z)=\lambda_{m,n,b}\,(mn)^{\frac{1}{2}z(Q-z)}\prod_{k=0}^{m-1}\prod_{l=0}^{n-1}\Gamma_{\frac{b\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{n}}}\left(\frac{z+kb+lb^{-1}}{\sqrt{mn}}\right)\.$$ (C.6)

for m, n ∈ Z≥1. Here, λm,n,b is some irrelevant constant that will cancel out of every formula we ever need, since we always have equally many Γb's in the numerator and denominator.

To prove this identity, one merely need to check that the LHS satisfies the expected functional equation (C.3). Most factors on the RHS telescope and the remaining factors combine into a single Gamma-function with the help of the multiplication formula of the Gamma function, which gives the expected result. Given that

$$\Gamma_{1}(z)=\frac{(2\pi)^{\frac{z}{2}}}{G(z)}\,$$ (C.7)

we hence have the following formula for Γ√ m n (z) in terms of G(z):

$$\Gamma_{\sqrt{\frac{m}{n}}}(z)=\lambda_{m,n}(mn)^{\frac{1}{2}i(\frac{\pi mn}{\sqrt{mn}}-i)}\prod_{k=0}^{m-1}\prod_{l=0}^{n-1}\Gamma_{1}\left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{mn}}+\frac{k}{m}+\frac{l}{n}\right)$$ $$=\lambda_{m,n}(2\pi)^{\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{mn}*}(mn)^{\frac{1}{2}i(\frac{\pi mn}{\sqrt{mn}}-i)}\prod_{k=0}^{m-1}\prod_{l=0}^{n-1}G\left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{mn}}+\frac{k}{m}+\frac{l}{n}\right)^{-1}\.$$ (C.8)

This formula is numerically useful when computing the double Gamma function on rational values of b 2 , since the Barnes G function has efficient numerical implementations.

### C.2 Zamolodchikov recursion for conformal blocks

Let us now review the explicit recursion relations that we use to efficiently compute the sphere four-point and the torus one-point Virasoro conformal blocks, originally derived in [124] and in [121, 122], respectively.

We parametrize the central charge of the Virasoro algebra as c = 1+6Q2 with Q = b+b −1 , and the holomorphic Virasoro weights of external primaries as hPi = Q2 4 +P 2 i . We also define

$$P_{r,s}=i\,\frac{rb+sb^{-1}}{2}\,\qquad A_{r,s}=\frac{1}{2}\prod_{\begin{subarray}{c}p=1-r\\ (p,q)\neq(0,0),(r,s)\end{subarray}}^{r}\prod_{\begin{subarray}{c}s\\ p\bar{b}+q\bar{b}^{-1}\end{subarray}}^{s}\frac{1}{pb+qb^{-1}}\.$$ (C.9)

The sphere four-point elliptic conformal block H (b) 0,4 (P4, P3, P2, P1; P|q) introduced in (7.19) admits a power series expansion in the elliptic nome q(z), defined in (7.20), and satisfies the following recursion relation,

$${\cal H}^{(b)}_{0,4}(P_{i};P|q)=1+\sum_{r,s\geq1}(16q)^{rs}\frac{A_{rs}B_{rs}(P_{1},P_{2})B_{rs}(P_{4},P_{3})}{P^{2}-P_{rs}^{2}}\,{\cal H}^{(b)}_{0,4}(P_{i};P\to(P_{rs}^{2}+rs)^{\frac{1}{2}}|q)\,$$ (C.10)

where the "fusion polynomials" Br,s are given by

$$B_{r,s}(P_{1},P_{2})=\prod_{p\stackrel{{2}}{{=}}1-r\stackrel{{q}}{{=}}1-s}^{r-1}\frac{2iP_{1}\pm2iP_{2}+pb+qb^{-1}}{2}\,$$ (C.11)

and we take the product over both sign choices.

Similarly, the torus one-point elliptic conformal block H (b) 1,1 (P1; P|q) introduced in (7.3) admits a power series expansion in q = e2πiτ and obeys the recursion relation,

$${\cal H}^{(b)}_{1,1}(P_{1};P|q)=1+\sum_{r,s\geq1}q^{rs}\frac{A_{rs}B_{rs}(P_{1},(P^{2}_{rs}+rs)^{\frac{1}{2}})B_{rs}(P_{1},P_{r,s})}{P^{2}-P^{2}_{r,s}}\\ \times{\cal H}^{(b)}_{1,1}(P_{1};P\to(P^{2}_{r,s}+rs)^{\frac{1}{2}}|q)\.$$ (C.12)

In this case, the product of the fusion polynomials may be written as

$$B_{r,s}(P_{1},(P_{r,s}^{2}+rs)^{\frac{1}{2}})B_{r,s}(P_{1},P_{r,s})=\prod_{p^{\frac{2}{2}1}}^{2r-1}\prod_{q^{\frac{2}{2}1}}^{2s-1}\frac{2iP_{1}\pm pb\pm qb^{-1}}{2}\,$$ (C.13)

where we take the product over all four sign choices.

The Liouville CFT sphere four-point functions decomposed into conformal blocks are

G(1234|z) ≡ VP1 (0)VP2 (z, z)VP3 (1)VP4 (∞) g=0 = Z ∞ 0 dP ρ(b) 0 (P)Cb(P1, P2, P)Cb(P3, P4, P) × F(b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4; P|z)F (b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4; P|z) , (C.14a) Gb(1234|z) ≡ Vb Pb1 (0)Vb Pb2 (z, z)Vb Pb3 (1)Vb Pb4 (∞) g=0 = Z C dPb (iPb) 2 2ρ (ˆb) 0 (iPb) Cbˆb (Pb1, Pb2, Pb)Cbˆb (Pb3, Pb4, Pb) × F(iˆb) 0,4 (Pb1, Pb2, Pb3, Pb4; Pb|z)F (iˆb) 0,4 (Pb1, Pb2, Pb3, Pb4; Pb|z) . (C.14b)

The four-point crossing symmetry relations take the form,

$G(1234|z)=G(3214|1-z)$, (C.15a)

$\widehat{G}(1234|z)=\widehat{G}(3214|1-z)$, (C.15b)

and

$G(1234|z)=|z|^{2(h_{4}-h_{3}-h_{2}-h_{1})}G(1324|z^{-1})$, (C.16a)

$$\widehat{G}(1234|z)=|z|^{2(\hat{h}_{4}-\hat{h}_{3}-\hat{h}_{2}-\hat{h}_{1})}\widehat{G}(1324|z^{-1})\,$$ (C.16b)

where hi = Q2 2 + P 2 i and hˆ i = − Qb2 2 + Pb2 i . Similarly, the modular covariance of the torus one-point functions (7.2b) read,

$$\left\langle V_{P_{1}}(0)\right\rangle_{g=1}^{(-\frac{1}{\tau})}=|\tau|^{2h_{1}}\left\langle V_{P_{1}}(0)\right\rangle_{g=1}^{(\tau)}\,,$$ (C.17a)

$$\left\langle\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{1}}(0)\right\rangle_{g=1}^{(-\frac{1}{\tau})}=|\tau|^{2\hat{h}_{1}}\left\langle\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{1}}(0)\right\rangle_{g=1}^{(\tau)}\,,$$ (C.17b)

where h1 = Q2 2 + P 2 1 and hˆ 1 = − Qb2 2 + Pb2 1 . (C.15), (C.16) and (C.17) may be directly verified numerically using the recursion relations described in this appendix.

## D Derivation of dilaton and string equations

In this appendix, we derive the dilaton and string equation (4.15a) and (4.15b) from the definition of the quantum volumes in terms of intersection numbers (4.14). This requires some algebraic geometry on Mg,n which we will explain in the derivation.

### D.1 Dilaton equation

We first derive the dilaton equation (4.15a). By definition, the left-hand-side equals

$$\text{LHS}=\int_{\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n+1}}\mathrm{e}^{\frac{c-13}{24}\kappa_{1}+\sum_{i}P_{i}^{2}\psi_{i}-\frac{c-1}{24}\psi_{n+1}-\sum_{m}\frac{B_{2m}}{(2m)(2m)!}\kappa_{2m}^{2m}}(\mathrm{e}^{\psi_{n+1}}-1)$$ (D.1) $$=\int_{\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n+1}}\psi_{n+1}\,\mathrm{e}^{\frac{c-13}{24}(\kappa_{1}-\psi_{n+1})+\sum_{i}P_{i}^{2}\psi_{i}-\sum_{m}\frac{B_{2m}}{(2m)(2m)!}(\kappa_{2m}-\psi_{n+1}^{2m})}\.$$

We used that we have by definition of the Bernoulli numbers

$${\rm e}^{x}-1=x\,{\rm e}^{\frac{x}{2}+\sum_{m\geq1}\frac{B_{2m}}{(2m)(2m)!}x^{2m}}$$ (D.2)

as a formal power series. The strategy is now to reduce the integral over Mg,n+1 to an integral over Mg,n, which means that we want to integrate out the fiber. This is precisely the definition of the pushforward π∗ by the forgetful map π : Mg,n+1 −→ Mg,n in cohomology. Thus we need to compute the pushforward of the integrand. The pushforward interacts with the pullback via the projection formula,

$\pi_{*}(\alpha\,\pi^{*}\beta)=(\pi_{*}\alpha)\,\beta\,\,.$

We can use this for our integrand with α = ψn+1. For β, we have to find a class which pulls back to the exponential. To do so, we first have to understand the behaviours of ψi and κm under pullback, which we explain here for completeness. See e.g. [177] for a more complete explanation.

We have

$\pi^{*}(\psi_{i})=\psi_{i}-\delta_{\{i,n+1\}}$.

Here δ{i,n+1} denotes the class in H2 (Mg,n+1) that is Poincar´e dual to the boundary divisor where the i-th and the (n + 1)-st point approach,

![](_page_99_Figure_6.jpeg)

(D.4) follows from the fact that the line bundle Li on Mg,n defining the ψ-classes (A.1) pulls back naturally to the corresponding line bundle on Mg,n+1. However, once we pass to the compactification, we have to be careful. sections of the line bundle Li are allowed to have simple poles at the boundary divisors. Since the pullback π ∗ (Li) does not see the (n + 1)-st marked point, we have to correct the formula by δ{i,n+1} to take this into account.

One can derive the pullback of κm from (D.4) as follows. Consider the maps

$$\begin{CD}\includegraphics[width=140.0pt]{28.45}\end{CD}$$ (D.6)

where π1 forgets the (n + 1)-st marked point and π2 forgets the (n + 2)-st marked point. We then have

$$\pi_{1}^{*}(\psi^{m+1}_{n+2})=(\psi_{n+2}-\delta_{\{n+1,n+2\}})^{m+1}=\psi^{m+1}_{n+2}-(-1)^{m}\delta^{m+1}_{\{n+1,n+2\}}\.$$ (D.7)

In the last step we used that the line bundle Ln+2 is trivial once we restrict it to the boundary divisor defined by δ{n+1,n+2} which implies that their product vanishes and thus there are no cross terms. We now pushforward this equation by the map π2. For this we first have to compute

$$(\pi_{2})_{*}(\delta^{m+1}_{\{n+1,n+2\}})=(\pi_{2})_{*}\big{(}\delta^{m}_{\{n+1,n+2\}}(\psi_{n+1}-\pi^{*}_{2}(\psi_{n+1}))\big{)}$$ (D.8) $$=-(\pi_{2})_{*}\big{(}\delta^{m}_{\{n+1,n+2\}}\ \pi^{*}_{2}(\psi_{n+1})\big{)}$$ $$=\psi_{n+1}(\pi_{2})_{*}(\delta^{m}_{\{n+1,n+2\}})$$ $$=(-1)^{m}\psi^{m+1}_{n+1}\ (\pi_{2})_{*}(\delta_{\{n+1,n+2\}})$$ $$=(-1)^{m}\psi^{m}_{n+1}\.$$

Here we used again the pullback (D.4) in the first line and the fact that ψn+1δ{n+1,n+2} = 0 in the second line. We then used the projection formula (D.3) and induction to reduce to the case m = 0. We then have (π2)∗(δ{n+1,n+2}) = 1 since the corresponding divisor intersects the fiber precisely once. Combining (D.7) and (D.8) gives

$$\pi_{1}^{*}\kappa_{m}=\pi_{1}^{*}(\pi_{2})_{*}(\psi_{n+2}^{m+1})=(\pi_{2})_{*}\pi_{1}^{*}(\psi_{n+2}^{m+1})=\kappa_{m}-\psi_{n+1}^{m}\.$$ (D.9)

Here we used the definition of κm, as well as the fact that we can commute the pullbacks and pushforwards of π1 and π2 since those fibers are independent. This is the desired pullback of κm.

Coming back to our original integrand (D.1), we realize that

$$\psi_{n+1}\ \pi^{*}\,{\rm e}^{\frac{c-1\lambda}{24}\kappa_{1}+\sum_{i}P_{i}^{2}\psi_{i}-\sum_{m}\frac{B_{nm}}{(m)(2m)!}\kappa_{2m}}$$ (D.10) $$=\psi_{n+1}\,{\rm e}^{\frac{c-1\lambda}{24}(\kappa_{1}-\psi_{n+1})+\sum_{i}P_{i}^{2}(\psi_{i}-\delta_{\{i,n+1\}}-\sum_{m}\frac{B_{nm}}{(2m)!(2m)!}(e_{2m}-\psi_{n+1}^{2m})$$ $$=\psi_{n+1}\,{\rm e}^{\frac{c-1\lambda}{24}(\kappa_{1}-\psi_{n+1})+\sum_{i}P_{i}^{2}\psi_{i}-\sum_{m}\frac{B_{nm}}{(2m)!(2m)!}(e_{2m}-\psi_{n+1}^{2m})}\,$$

where we used again that ψn+1 δ{i,n+1} = 0 and thus we can omit the boundary classes in the exponent. Hence the integrand is of the form of the projection formula (D.3). We thus have

$$\text{LHS}=\int_{\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{\theta,n}}\pi_{*}\Big{(}\psi_{n+1}\,\pi^{*}\,e^{\frac{c-13}{24}\kappa_{1}+\sum_{i}P_{i}^{2}\psi_{i}-\sum_{m}\frac{B_{2m}}{(2m)(2m)!}\kappa_{2m}}\Big{)}$$ (D.11) $$=\pi_{*}(\psi_{n+1})\int_{\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{\theta,n}}e^{\frac{c-13}{24}\kappa_{1}+\sum_{i}P_{i}^{2}\psi_{i}-\sum_{m}\frac{B_{2m}}{(2m)(2m)!}\kappa_{2m}}\Big{)}$$ $$=\pi_{*}(\psi_{n+1})\,\psi_{\theta,n}^{(0)}(\mathbf{P})\.$$

Here we used that π∗(ψn+1) has degree zero and can thus be identified with a number and taken out of the integral. The remaining integral is precisely again the definition of the quantum volume (4.14). It thus remains to compute π∗(ψn+1). By definition ψn+1 is the first Chern class of the line bundle Ln+1. A section of Ln+1 on the fiber is a holomorphic differential on the surface that is allowed to have poles at the marked points. The pushforward is then simply computing the degree of this line bundle. The degree of the canonical line bundle (the line bundle of holomorphic differentials) is known to be 2g − 2 and every marked point adds one to this. Thus

$\pi_{*}(\psi_{n+1})=2g-2+n$, (D.12)

which finishes the proof of the dilaton equation (4.15a).

### D.2 String equation

The derivation of the string equation (4.15b) is now very similar. The left hand side is equal to

LHS = Z Mg,n+1 e ψn+1 − 1 ψn+1 e c−13 24 κ1+ P i P 2 i ψi− c−1 24 ψn+1− P m B2m (2m)(2m)!κ2m = Z Mg,n+1 e c−13 24 (κ1−ψn+1)+P i P 2 i ψi− P m B2m (2m)(2m)! (κ2m−ψ 2m n+1) = Z Mg,n+1 e P i P 2 i δ{i,n+1} π ∗ e c−13 24 κ1+ P i P 2 i ψi− P m B2m (2m)(2m)!κ2m . (D.13)

We inserted again the definition of the Bernoulli numbers (D.2) and then used the same pullback as above. Contrary to before, we can however not omit the boundary classes since no ψn+1 prefactor is present. We thus compensated for them by including them in the prefactor. We can now pushforward to Mg,n and use the projection formula (D.3). This gives

LHS = Z Mg,n π∗ e P j P 2 j δ{j,n+1} e c−13 24 κ1+ P i P 2 i ψi− P m B2m (2m)(2m)!κ2m = Xn j=1 X k≥1 P 2k j k! Z Mg,n π∗ δ k {j,n+1} e c−13 24 κ1+ P i P 2 i ψi− P m B2m (2m)(2m)!κ2m = Xn j=1 X k≥1 P 2k j k! Z Mg,n (−ψj ) k−1 e c−13 24 κ1+ P i P 2 i ψi− P m B2m (2m)(2m)!κ2m = Xn j=1 Z Mg,n e P 2 j ψj − 1 ψj e c−13 24 κ1+ P i̸=j P 2 i ψi− P m B2m (2m)(2m)!κ2m = Xn j=1 Z Pj 0 (2Pj dPj ) Z Mg,n e c−13 24 κ1+ P i P 2 i ψi− P m B2m (2m)(2m)!κ2m = Xn j=1 Z Pj 0 (2Pj dPj ) V (b) g,n(P) . (D.14)

Going from the first line to the second line in (D.14) we used that the divisors corresponding to δ{i,n+1} and δ{j,n+1} do not intersect for i ̸= j and thus δ{i,n+1}δ{j,n+1} = 0 for i ̸= j. We can also omit the constant term in the power series expansion since π∗(1) = 0 for dimensional reasons. We then used the pushforward of the boundary classes derived in eq. (D.8). The rest is simple algebra and recognizing the definition of the quantum volume (4.14).

 Using modular neural networks to 
model self-consciousness and self-
representation for artificial entities 
 
 
 
Milton Martínez Luaces , Celina Gayoso,  Juan P azos Sierra and Alfonso Rodríguez-Patón.  
 
 
 
Abstract-  Self-consciousness implies not only self or 
group recognition, but also real knowledge of one’s own identity. 
Self-consciousness is only possible if  an individual is intelligent 
enough to formulate an abstract self-representation. Moreover, it 
necessarily entails the capability of  referencing and using this self-
representation in connection with other cognitive features, such as 
inference, and the anticipation of  the consequences of both one’s 
own and other individuals’ acts.  
In this paper, a cognitive architecture for self-
consciousness is proposed. This cognitive architecture includes 
several modules: abstraction, sel f-representation, other individuals' 
representation, decision and acti on modules. It includes a learning 
process of self-representation by direct (self-experience based) and 
observational learning (based on the observation of other 
individuals). For model implemen tation a new approach is taken 
using Modular Artificial Neural Networks (MANN). For model testing, a virtual environment has been implemented. This virtual 
environment can be described as a holonic system or holarchy, 
meaning that it is composed of  autonomous entities that behave 
both as a whole and as part of a greater whole. The system is composed of a certain number of holons interacting. These holons  
are equipped with cognitive features , such as sensory perception, 
and a simplified model of personalit y and self-representation. We 
explain holons’ cognitive architecture that enables dynamic self-representation. We analyse the effect of holon interaction, focusing 
on the evolution of the holon’s abst ract self-representation. Finally, 
the results are explained and analysed and conclusions drawn.  
 
Keywords-  holons,  modular neural networks, self-
conciousness, self-representation. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
Understanding consciousness has been defined as "the 
ultimate intellectual challenge of this new millennium" [10]. 
Since ancient cultures, consciousness has been discussed by 
philosophers, jurists and religious leaders. The word 
“consciousness” comes from Latin conscientia , a word used 
in juridical Roman documents by writers like Cicero [33]. 
Literally, conscientia  means “knowledge (science) with”, 
that is, shared knowledge. Historically, it was first used to refer to moral conscience, as in  Christian Codices [24]. From 
the very beginning conscientia  was associated with 
responsibility (moral or legal) . Now, conciousness constitutes  the basis of modern legal guilt-penalty systems 
[31]. In this sense, consciousness is a kind of self-awareness; it is a condition for cognition.  More recently, consciousness has been focused by 
modern disciplines such as  Psychology, Neuroscience and 
Artificial Intelligence (AI). Especially in AI, an important 
aim is the definition an later implementation of a model for consciousness. In this line of work, the first step is finding 
an answer to the main question: “Where does consciousness 
reside?” Is it immaterial, like “the soul”, or is there a 
physical support - a neural correlate - for consciousness? 
[29]. A neural correlate of co nsciousness (NCC, according to 
[6]) are "neural systems and properties of that systems, 
which are associated with co nscious mental states" [14]. 
Another definition of a NCC,  which may perhaps be commonly accepted, is “a neural  correlate of consciousness 
is a neural system (S) plus a certain state of this system (NS), which together are correla ted with a certain state of 
consciousness (C) [10]. The ex istence of a NCC is widely 
accepted in scientific commun ity, but unfortunately "how 
these neural correlates actually produce consciousness, is left 
untouched" [14]. This is not surprising, because the study of 
consciousness is not an easy task, taking into account the 
"complexity of the neuronal ar chitectures involved, it seems 
risky to draw conclusions simply on the basis of intuitive 
reasoning" [10]. Due to this complexity, Francis Crick opted 
to defer even a consciousness definition to avoid precipitation [8]. 
 Consciousness can be divided in two important 
categories. The first category is similar to self-knowledge, 
which has to do with the ordinary notion of being conscious. 
Many people think that this kind of consciousness is the same as knowledge. Actually, though, it is a way of 
developing declarative memories. Declarative memories are 
memories that can be recalled and told to others. The second category, called “qualia”, refers to the idea that the feelings 
associated with a sensation are independent of the sensory 
input. As this is a more metaphysical category than the first 
one, it will not be considered in this paper. Qualia are 
frequently formulated in questions like, “Why is the colour 
red, red?” “Does the colour red appear to be th e same colour 
to you?” Rita Levi Montalcini, the Nobel Laureate for 
Medicine, pointed out that the three main lines of research 
into the consciousness problem were: the neurosciences, 
cognitive science and AI. This paper is concerned with the 
two last lines, and especially cognitive science.  
 Another important point that is present in the approach we use in this paper is that consciousness research 
must focus on both cognitive processes and beahaviour. The 
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION
Issue 2, Volume 2, 2008
163     Manuscript received December 7, 2007; Revised June 2, 2008 essential idea in AI, proposed by Turing in his test (as a 
measure) and his machine (as a medium), can be established 
as follows: “The brain is just another kind of computer. It doesn’t matter how you design an artificially intelligent 
system, it just has to produce human like behaviour”. 
Nevertheless, this behaviourism is the main problem in the classic AI field. The Turing test, which takes intelligence 
and human behaviour to be equivalent, limits the vision of 
what is possible: from a connectionist or a symbolist point of view, it focuses on behaviour and ignores other relevant 
aspects. In fact, one can be intelligent by thinking and 
understanding without acting. Ignoring what happens in the brain and focusing only on behaviour has been and is the 
greatest obstacle to understanding intelligence. 
Of course, such profound questions are quite 
difficult to answer because our knowledge of the human 
brain and cognitive processes is still poor. Despite the 
limitations we have in this field, some psychologists have made considerable advances by observing cognitive features 
in connection with human – and sometimes animal – 
behaviour. In this paper we intend to analyse cognitive 
features and their relation to the learning process and 
behaviour. From a cognitive science viewpoint, we base our 
research on an analytical approach to consciousness, 
focusing on the self-consciousness feature. We propose a cognitive architecture for self-consciousness  using Modular 
Artificial Neural Networks (MANN). We implemented a 
virtual environment with intelligent virtual holons to test the 
proposed model. Finally, we an alyse the results are and draw 
some conclusions 
   
II. CONSCIOUSNESS FEATURES 
 
Because it is impossible to understand consciousness as a 
whole, the most common approach - as is usual in science - 
is analytical. This means that consciousness is defined injectively, that is, based on the features habitually 
associated with consciousne ss or the features in which 
consciousness is believed to pl ay a role. Bernard Baars [5]  
and Igor Alexander [1] have suggested several cognitive features of consciousness beings. From these and other 
researchers, we can extract several cognitive features that 
must be present in the consciousness phenomenon. These 
features can be divided into three abstraction levels: basic, intermediate and advanced features.  
As we consider consciousne ss as a holonic system, each 
feature can be viewed as a whole and, at the same time, as a 
part of the holonic system. View ed individually, as a whole, 
these features are not basic at all. However, viewed as parts 
of consciousness, they can be described as the building blocks of consciousness. This level encompasses reactivity , 
adaptability , associative memory , learning  ability and 
optimisation . A lot of successful research has been done into 
modelling and implementing these features. 
Intermediate features are the result of a composition or 
interaction of basic features  (level 1). They include 
abstraction, prediction, anticipation, generalization, 
inference, emotion, motivation and imagination. Some 
research has been done focusi ng on these features with 
patchy results. 
Consciousness also include a dvanced features. These are 
complex and require a cognitive architecture composed of features from levels 1 and 2. They include free will, moral judgement and self-consciousness.  As we have already 
mentioned, these features are the hardest to model and to 
find a suitable technology for implementation. In this paper, 
we focus especially in self-consciousness. 
 
 
 
III.  A NEURAL CORRELATE OF SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS 
 
It is sometimes said that consciousness does not have its 
own neural correlate, but it is ju st the sum of all the features 
listed above [5]. Contrary to this, other researchers postulate 
that consciousness is not merely a sum of cognitive features. 
They claim that, once all these features are present in an 
individual, they interact with each other, generating new 
features at a higher abstraction level. As a result of this 
emerging behaviour , “the whole is greater than the sum of 
the parts” [19]. The fact is, in any case, that consciousness is 
always associated with these features. Therefore, a lot of 
research work has been done proposing models for each 
consciousness-related f eature and also possible 
implementations in the field of artificial intelligence and 
cognitive science have been essayed [16] [17] [38] [39]. As 
we have already said, in this paper, we focus on the last feature listed above: self-consciousness   
There are different ideas, and consequently different 
definitions, of self-conscious ness. Some researchers [22] 
[27] make a distinction between self-awareness  (knowledge 
of oneself as an entity) and self-consciousness . Self-
consciousness has been defined as “the possession of a concept of identity, as well as the ability to use this concept 
to think about oneself” [26].  In some animal species, we can 
observe earlier states on the path towards self-consciousness . 
Most mammals and birds can recognize other individuals of 
their species as being similar. This means they have a sense 
of belonging in terms of their species [40]. A few superior mammals not only have a sense of self-belonging , but also 
demonstrate self-awareness . Self-awareness means they can 
distinguish their own image from that of other individuals, which is one of the signs that confirms they have this 
cognitive feature. This select group now lists chimpanzees 
[42], dolphins [35], a recent addition, elephants [34], and of 
course, human beings. 
In the artificial intelligence fi eld, several researchers are 
working on the implementation of self-awareness  and self-
consciousness  in robots [25] or even in software holons or 
soft-bots [15]. Most are focusing on self-image recognition, 
and robots were recently equipp ed with this feature. It is 
noteworthy, however, that a lthough recognition of one’s 
own image implies self-belonging  or even what has been 
called self-body awareness  [30], this does not necessarily 
prove that the entity (natural or artificial) has self-
consciousness . To be able to say this, the entity would also 
have to be able to build an abstract self-representation  and 
also be able to use it as essential information for properly interacting with other individuals and with the environment [27] [37] [9].  
There is no doubt that self-representation  is a key 
component for self-consciousness , because “how can anyone 
have knowledge of you that you cannot represent?” [22]. 
Conscious individuals have internal representations of 
things, but self-representation  is different from this “primary 
representations”. It has been considered as a case of “secondary representation”, which are "cognitions that 
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION
Issue 2, Volume 2, 2008
164 represent past, future, pretended, or purely hypothetical 
situations in prepositional form" [4]. It is evident that self-
representation must be a secondary one, because it is "a 
constructed mental model of oneself that can be manipulated in fantasy" [4] This cognitive structures are closely related 
with perspective-taking be cause “self-recognition and 
spontaneous perspective-taking develop in close synchrony 
because both require a capacity for secondary 
representation" [4]. 
This self-representation  must necessarily be abstract to 
support abstract inference pro cesses. It also needs to be 
dynamic and flexible enough to adapt to both changes to its own self and changes in the environment. Obviously, this 
would be impossible with a static self-representation. 
Contrariwise, an individual need s to learn about itself - like 
humans do –, and its self-representation  would undergo 
changes induced by a learning process throughout the 
individual’s whole lifetime. In this process, individuals interaction has a great influen ce. The poet Arthur Rimbaud 
said  ''I is some one Else'' (''Je est quelqu_un d_autre''), suggesting that we conceive ou rselves through the eyes of 
others" [36]. Indeed, other individuals influence our self-representation because we not  only build a secondary 
representation of the self, but al so of the others. This other 
individuals representations are also a case of secondary representation because "it is not a perception of a situation but rather a constructed mental image of another person's 
perception of this situation" [4].  
By this interaction, the individual construct relations with 
other individuals, and as a result "each individual has an overall repertoire of selves, each of which stems from a 
relationship with a significant other", This becomes "a source of, the interpersonal pa tterns that characterize the 
individual. Each self is keyed to a mental representation of a significant other" [3]. This source of information becomes a sort "narrative center [...] of all subjective experiences and 
memories in a given individual" [11]. Taking this facts into 
account, we consider that firs t of all, a self-conciousness 
model must include both self and other individual 
representations and the close relation between these 
cognitive features must be also defined. On the other hand, because of the importance of i ndividual interaction in self 
building process, we considered that a simulator that includes interaction between modelled systems would be an 
adequate testing strategy for self-consciousness  models.  
Another important and essential feature is to be able to 
reference this abstract information and apply it in connection with other cognitive features. One such feature is self-
imagination . Self-imagination implies the ability to “see” 
one’s own representation, a cert ain conception of what one is 
like. Another is self-inference , meaning the ability to infer 
information and reason inductively and deductively about 
oneself. Finally, anticipation  is another related feature. 
Anticipation is the ability to foresee results taking into account knowledge about oneself. 
Clearly, self-consciousness  is a complex cognitive 
feature. It includes an abstract and dynamic self-
representation , a mechanism for using this representation 
and interaction with other cognitiv e features to evaluate this 
representation for inference and anticipation. This suggests a 
modular cognitive architecture.  Taking these points into 
account, we chose ANN to provide a neural correlate of self-
consciousness in intelligent individuals. Information cannot be addressed without taking into 
account both natural and artific ial information processing 
devices, because information is an abstraction that is only 
materialised when it has a physical representation. In 
particular, self-information has a representation, which, in 
this paper, is called self-representation. This makes it possible to use and process this information. Cognitive 
capabilities like self-consciousness and abstraction can be 
implemented to provide devices with intelligent behaviour, which is the goal of Artificial Intelligence. In this paper, 
self-consciousness, and abstracti on, or the ability to separate 
the essential from the secondary, are built into the holons. 
Abstraction is necessary for recognizing other individuals, because these representations ar e an abstraction of reality, 
which is useful for each holon’s behaviour [2] [13] [32]. 
The term informon is used in this paper to designate the 
basic component of information.  Indeed, an informon is an 
information entity. Information can take the form of data, 
news or knowledge. Information is produced when some 
degree of uncertainty exists. As Sanders [41] suggested, 
information is produced as a result of an uncertainty 
reduction process. Denning [12] defines information as the 
meaning that someone attaches to a data set. Brook [7] gave another definition making a distinction between 
“knowledge”, as a structure of linked concepts, from 
“information” which he defines as a small part of 
“knowledge”. Following on from this, Mason  indicates that 
“information can be viewed as a collection of symbols […] 
that has the potential of changing the cognitive state of the decision-making entity” [23]. 
If we lump all these definitions together, information can 
be defined as “a difference, caused by an underlying process, almost always driven by interest, able to transform a 
cognitive structure through a collection of symbols that has 
the potential of changing the cognitive state of a [holon]”. In a holonic System, holons are immersed in a medium. A 
“medium” is defined as any e nvironment that can transmit 
signals or phenomena. Phenomena appear as information to 
perception. The perception of phenomena is certainly a form 
of information. Signals are represented by a code of signs. 
Signals can be coded to produce signs. Signs are the way in which signals are coded. Sign study and analysis is called 
semiotics.  
Data are signs organized in a certain pattern. Data are 
representations of phenomena , that is, they present 
phenomena again, hence re-present. When data is 
interpreted, that is, given a meaning, structure, relevance and 
purpose, you get news. News can be defined as messages 
that cause changes in receptor perception. News is transported between systems that have the ability to 
understand, assimilate and use it. News that is combined 
with action applied becomes useful information.  
Knowledge and wisdom are two higher level cognitive 
concepts. On the one hand, knowledge can be defined as “news plus action plus application”: ideas, rules, procedures, models, laws, theories that gu ide decisions and actions. On 
the other hand, wisdom is “knowledge plus experience, plus principles and ethical and aest hetic constraints, judgements 
and preferences”. Wisdom can be individual or collective.  
From a formal viewpoint signs have three aspects: syntax, 
semantics and pragmatics. In this paper, from a syntactic viewpoint, each holon’s state, growth and self-confidence is 
represented by a numerical value. Each numerical value represents a state, a growth and a self-confidence level. 
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION
Issue 2, Volume 2, 2008
165 Finally, from a pragmatic viewpoint, each holon decides its 
actions based on the values of other holons. On the strength 
of their “representational” basis, there is no way of telling data, news and knowledge apart, as they actually use the 
same signs and signals. Instead, we can identify how and for 
what purpose these structures ar e used. This way they can be 
categorized. This connects with the problem of the 
“reference framework” for interpretation.  
As stated above, informa tion is out of the question 
without an information processing device. Therefore, we use 
the term holon  to denote the basic information processing 
element [21]. This term is used then to refer to entities that 
behave autonomously and, at the same time, as part of a 
bigger whole. A holon then can be defined as an independent 
element that behaves autonomously and is self-organizing, 
recursive and cooperative. A hol on must contain information 
processes, and possibly physical processes. In addition, a holon must be able to cooperate, because it behaves autonomously and acts as part of a whole. Note that holons 
are not self-sufficient. Neverthele ss, they are part of a whole. 
This is why they need to be ab le to cooperate, a process by 
means of which a set of such entities develop commonly 
accepted plans that they implem ent in a distributed manner. 
As explained above, the ability to cooperate is a must. It 
must be possible to add new entities, and delete and modify 
others in such a holonic sy stem. Additionally, each holon 
can self-replicate, which provides the functionality of 
recursion, self-organization and self-production.  
All holons have four impulses: action, communion, 
transcendence, dissolution. Holons can be classed by the following levels:  
Instruction : this level contains the primary holons, 
cooperative entities that process data. They produce new data and simple news. They ar e specialized and are able to 
perform primitive operations.  
Component : component holon emerges when the 
elementary instruction-level holons are structured 
hierarchically (holarchy); its f unctionality is greater than the 
sum of its instruction holons and it is capable of outputting 
more sophisticated news and/or knowledge.  
Entity : entity holons are formed by means of hierarchical 
relationships between component holons. They have beliefs, motivations and intentions and are able to change their 
behaviour based on previous experience. 
Organization : collaborative entities are called holonic 
organization. 
In this paper, holons are composed of instructions (level 
1), and their final cognitive  architecture has several 
components (level 2). They are, as a whole, entities (level 3) 
because of their data, news and knowledge processing level 
and their ability to change behaviour according to previous 
experience. However, viewed as part of a whole, the whole, 
that is, the system, represents an organization (level 4). A 
holonic structure should consider the cooperation and 
collaboration domain. Each holon, with its own goals within the domain, operates and comm unicates with other holons, 
providing the context in which they can locate, contact and 
interact with each other. 
 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 
 
How could self-representation  be modelled in a software 
system? One might think at first glance that it is quite easy 
for a software system to know its  own state, as any system is able to read its own variables at any time. But that is not 
really self-consciousness . If we apply direct self-knowledge, 
what we get is simply a readi ng of the system state, which 
has nothing to do with self-consciousness. Take human beings, for example, the idea we have of ourselves (meaning 
our qualities, strengths and weaknesses) does not come directly as information provided by our own body, but it is 
built as a result of a learning process. When we are very 
young we have an unrealistic id ea of what we are really like, 
but the longer we live – provid ed our learning process works 
properly - the more realistic our self-representation becomes.   
Therefore, from a cognitive science viewpoint, system 
variables must be separated from self-representation . This 
means that, on the one hand, we would have variables 
concerning holon features (which means its personality if we 
think of it as a feature vector with a different level of development in each variable) and, on the other hand, the 
holon’s perception of itself. As already mentioned, an 
abstract representation is needed  of this personality, as is a 
learning process for changi ng this representation. 
Furthermore, self-consciousness  is out of the question 
without the ability to continuously sense the environment and the self-representation  and then adapt actions 
accordingly. For this reason, a process for using this self-
information in connection with other cognitive features, such as inference, anticipation and optimization through a 
learning process also needs to be implemented. As the 
psychologist Phillip Johnson-Laird said, “Planning and action control requires a self model, including its goals, 
abilities, options and an actual state” [20].  This learning 
process would not be possible if the conscious entity is 
isolated. The self-consciousne ss learning process includes 
interaction with other individuals. Many research works in 
the field of psychology have shown that interaction is 
essential for developing consciousness [28]. Additionally, 
this process also has to be dynamic to allow learning process optimization.     Because of the above features of self-
consciousness  and self-representation  we considered ANN 
to be a good implementation choice. On the one hand, ANN are an adequate  representation for a neural correlate of 
consciousness as they are biol ogically inspired. Incidentally, 
brain processes are quite different from traditional 
(algorithmic) computation. There are no explicit algorithms 
in biological neural systems. Contrariwise, intelligence, and 
consciousness, resides in neuron connectivity. Taking this into account, an ANN is suitable for modelling 
consciousness, as it does not incorporate problem-solving 
algorithms, and cognitive features reside in the weight configuration. Furthermore, as  ANN are modular, they are 
adequate for implementing cognitive architectures. Being dynamic, they provide for dynamic self-representation . 
Finally, ANNs are learning trainable by definition. This 
allows the self-representation  to evolve and be optimized 
throughout the learning process.                   In the case of human beings, self-representation  is not 
confined to an individual having a standard internal 
representation of him- or herself as a human being, as 
opposed to some other species ( self-belonging ), but also 
extends to the abstract represen tation of his or her self with 
his or her unique personality. Therefore, in our virtual environment, we equipped holons with features that 
determine their abilities and behavior. First, we defined holons that had a particular size and shape. Depending on 
these features, the holon has a bigger or smaller chance in 
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION
Issue 2, Volume 2, 2008
166 competitions with other holons. A holon’s size grows from a 
random initial size as time passes. After a period of time, 
they disappear, and a new holon  appears in their place. 
These features were added to prevent the virtual 
environment reaching a state where whole holon population 
was in a terminal status, as this would make it difficult to 
test the evolution of self-representation and associated 
processes. After testing with a different number of growth 
levels, the number of possible growth levels was finally set at ten, because this extended the holon life cycle, facilitating 
learning process. These levels are represented in the virtual environment by increasing the holon’s diameter. Another feature, which can be defined as holon  “state” is dependent 
on factors that we will explain later. Ten “states” (0 to 9) were also defined and represented as different colors: violet, 
dark blue, light blue, dark green, light green, yellow, orange, 
magenta, light red and dark red. Fig. 1 shows holon 
interaction. 
           
Figure 1. Evolution of relative feature weighs. 
In this paper, we consider consciousness as a result of social 
interaction with an internal l earning process. Therefore, we 
created a virtual environment,  with a certain number of 
interacting holons to test the proposed model. The 
interaction was defined as a competition between holons, 
where each holon competes with another (one at a time), for 
example, in a contest. In the virtual environment, the holons 
sometimes attack, and sometimes flee other holons, depending on how they rate themselves ( self-consciousness ), 
meaning their evaluation of the perception they have of their 
own qualities ( self-representation ). These holons were also 
defined with the aim of observing other individuals’ 
behavior to optimize the accu racy of their own abstract 
representation by both learning from their own experiences and observing other holons’ experiences ( observational 
learning ). Throughout this learning process, the abstract 
representation the holon has of other individuals evolves, 
but, more importantly, it also improves its self-
representation . This improves its evaluation and anticipation 
of its future actions.   
Holons perceive growth true to its real value, but state is 
perceived with some error, depending on the individual. 
Initially, these values are set. Therefore, the holon  focuses 
first on learning the relative importance of each quality 
(growth and state) for comp etition through a learning 
process. As a result, a neural network module represents some kind of “competition function” in each  holon. In a 
second phase, when holons have an approximate notion of how to evaluate their own qu alities, the accuracy of their 
perception of others and themselves also tends to improve. 
This means that self-representation  evolves in this second 
phase and becomes more realistic.  Finally, a self-confidence  
feature was added. This feature is defined as the length of the random error factor added for self-representation . This 
way we could generate di fferent self-representation 
tendencies and test their effect on holon activity.  
In the first learning phase, observational learning is very 
important because it allows holons to learn the 
representation function. In the second phase, direct learning 
allows each holon to learn its own qualities and to improve 
its self-perception. 
As our goal is to build a NN implementation of self-
representation and self-consciousness, we define the initial conditions as follows:  
1. Representation Function : This function means the 
contribution of each holon’s  features to its global value. 
This function is initially unknown. Assuming this 
function is the same for all holons; it is only present in self-representation. In the initial state, this function is 
unknown and therefore randomly set. 
 
2. Other holon  global values : These values are 
unknown in the initial state. Nevertheless, they are initialized with approximations (as a result of an imperfect perception). We used a random error function 
uniformly distributed across a range of 10%. We also 
assumed that while the global values are unknown, the individual holon features are known. 
 3. Global own value : In the initial state this value is 
unknown and the first approximation is the self-
representation neural network output. We also 
considered the holon feature values as unknown, and 
therefore randomly initialized. 
 
A learning process is also needed to evolve self-
representation and self-consciousness. This learning process 
includes two different ways of learning: 
 
1.   Self-Experience Learning
: When a holon  has a 
confrontation with another,  it forecasts the possible 
outcome. If the forecast is wrong (the result is the opposite of what was expected), the holon adjusts the 
representation of the other holon  according to reality 
and also adjusts its self-representation to include the 
result function. 
 
2. Vicarious Learning : When the holon  observes a 
confrontation between two other holons, it also makes a forecast of the possible outcome. If the forecast is wrong, the holon  adjusts the representation of global 
values of both observed holons and also adjusts the result function in the implicit neural network of each 
holon. As ANN have just two layers in these cases, a 
Delta-rule algorithm was implemented to adjust 
neurons.

process:

Figure 2. Learning process .  
                        
Neural Networks were used for abstract self-
representation, representation of other individuals and also 
function evaluation. This means that it represents the process 
of using self-information to anticipate and decide future actions. Fig. 3 shows the topologies used for each module. 
 
 
Figure 3. Neural Networks topology  
 Clearly, multi-layer perceptrons were used (they were the 
preferred option as they have proved to be universal approximators [17], but any other kind of ANN can possibly 
be used). Each holon is equipped with a certain number of 
ANN. The system is, therefore, a modular-ANN (MANN). The main ANN module contains the self-representation 
(including feature values and evaluation function), and other 
modules have representations with feature values of other holons.  
 
Self-Representation Module   
Each holon  has a self-representation (the ANN topology 
on the left) containing the holon features, and the global 
value is the ANN output.  
The relative impact of each f eature is represented by the 
weights that connect the hidden and output layers. The 
hidden layer input values (f eature values) are used as 
weights in one of the connections between the input and 
hidden layers. The other weights in this layer are set at 0, 
and input values from the input layer are set at 1. As a result, 
processing this multi-layer perceptron returns an output value that represents the global value of each holon from its 
own viewpoint (self-representation). When this global value changes, all the weights can be 
adjusted by back-propagation. Nevertheless, in case of 
connections between the input and hidden layers, these weights are used to calculate new s, g and c for hidden layer 
inputs. Later, these weights are set as mentioned above.  
Note that both the feature values and the evaluation 
function (based on NN-weights) are represented in this self-representation module. 
 Other Holon Representation Module 
 
As we assume that the evaluation function is the same for 
all holons, we only represent feature values for other holons. The global value of these holons is calculated as a weighted 
sum of these feature values. This is represented by the net on the right in Figure 3. 
As a result of this M-ANN ar chitecture, each holon will 
be able to recognize other individuals’ capabilities. Additionally, each holon will have  a self-representation. 
Self-representation means how the holon views itself. This information is used by the holon’s central process to 
evaluate its possibilities compared with other individuals in 
social interaction, as it can  be seen in Figure 4. 
 
 
Figure 4. Cognitive Architecture 
     
 
V.  RESULTS 
 
After implementation, we tested the system with 
different initial configurations where we primarily varied the 
number of holons and perception error range. As a result, we 
observed how self-representation evolved (in each holon) and its influence on later holon behaviour. 
First, we will analyse the evolution of relative feature 
weighting. Self-representation converges at the relative contribution of each holon  feature to global value. This 
means that the individual not only learns more about itself globally (global value) in a second phase of learning process, 
but also learns more about th e relative importance of each of 
its own features. This is shown in Fig. 5.

Figure 4. Features representation evolution. 
 
This chart shows the conver gence of the result function 
for the three implemented feat ures, and, as a result, the 
convergence of self-knowledge for each of the three features 
of a holon. Fig. 5 illustrates how the error level decreases in 
a few steps to an acceptable le vel of about 0.05, and then 
converges to an almost exact perception of each feature in a 
second phase. Fig. 6 shows the relative perception error of 
three holons after consecutiv e contests. Because the first 
holon (in white) avoided contests after the 6th iteration, 
learning was unsuccessful in its case. Anyway, all holons 
tend to minimize their perception error, and also improve their forecasting accuracy.  
 
Figure 6.  Self-representation evolution. 
 
Fig. 7 shows how self-representation evolves 
throughout the process. Again, there are three holons, plus 
their global values (from th eir own viewpoint). In these 
cases error is minimized after an initial period of instability, 
product of the interaction with differently valued holons.

VI.  CONCLUSIONS 
 
As discussed in this paper, we analysed the relation 
between self-consciousness and self-representation . Our 
focus was that conscious indivi duals constantly modify their 
behaviour depending on the representation they have of 
other individuals, but more importantly, depending on the 
use they make of the information provided by their self-
representation. 
With the model proposed and implemented in this paper, 
we were able to observe self-representation  implemented 
with holons and found that was useful for representing: 
 
1. Time-dependent evolution of self-representation  
2. Influence of self-confidence on self-consciousness 
3. Relation between level of interaction and self-consciousness development. 
 
We can conclude that the use of ANN is suitable for 
implementing cognitive features, particularly in the case of 
self-consciousness and self-representation, for several 
reasons: 
 1. Biologically inspired 
 
The human brain is a physical organ, and its thinking part 
is based on neurons. The proposed model must ape this. ANN imitates physical neuron structure, their connectivity 
and mechanisms. As ANN are biol ogically inspired systems, 
they are suitable for modeling consciousness. 
 
2. Non-Algorithmic  
In a physical brain, there are not any algorithms; 
intelligent beings’ thought processes are completely different from the way computers traditionally operate, which is 
algorithmic. As consciousness resides in weights 
configuration there is a neural correlate.  
3. Modularity 
 
Modularity is essential for modeling in cognitive science. 
We have seen that there are many different levels of cognitive features. Some features are composed; others 
interact with each other. Fu rthermore, if a module is 
damaged, the functionality degrades, but the system 
continues operating. 
 
4. Adaptability  
Cognitive architectures with ANN are also flexible and 
adaptable through a learning pro cess. In the approach taken 
in this paper, self-consciousness and self-representation are 
not innate features, but are the result of an interaction 
process. In this process the individual interacts with the environment and acquires capabilities of self-consciousness 
and self-representation through a learning process. 
 
The interaction among perception, anticipation and 
decision processes and self-consciousness has been 
thoroughly analyzed by psychologists, neurobiologists and 
engineers working in cognitive science. In this paper, we 
saw how MANN-equipped holons in a simplified cognitive 
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION
Issue 2, Volume 2, 2008
169 model interact with each othe r and how self-representation 
and self-consciousness evolves as a result. 
 
As we could analyze in this paper, self-consciousness is 
a complex cognitive feature. Despite is not feasible to design a realistic model in the current state-of-art, it is possible, by an abstraction, to  focus on some aspects of this 
cognitive feature. In this paper, we focused on how self-consciousness is based on self-representation.  Particularly, we focused on how self-representation is not an inherent 
feature of conscious entities, but it develops as a result of a 
learning process. An important conclusion, is that this learning process depends essentially on interaction between 
conscious entities, and it can  include both direct and 
observational learning. Of course, the self-representation 
model and the learning processes described in this paper are  
quite far from a realistic model. Nevertheless, they ilustrate 
that it is possible to model a dynamic self-representation in artificial entities that evolves as a result of a learning 
process based on interaction. Moreover, it also shows that 
according to some consciousness’ properties such as 
modularity, dynamic nature and learning-based 
development, Modular Neural Networks appear to be suitable structures for model implementation.

# Artificial Consciousness Module (ACM)

[![Image frame from Blade Runner the producer of memories](./repo_images/NIQM2NDZ._for_github.png)](https://theconsciousness.ai)

## Overview

The **Artificial Consciousness Module (ACM)** is our ambitious project to explore synthetic awareness in AI systems. We're combining modern AI technologies with virtual reality environments and emotional reinforcement learning to investigate the potential emergence of consciousness-like behaviors in non-biological systems.

Our design centers around creating systems that can form emotional connections through simulated scenarios designed to trigger attention and awareness mechanisms. The goal is to develop AI agents with the ACM that can form and store emotional memories, all while adhering to Asimov's Three Laws as ethical guidelines.

├── memory/
│   ├── emotional_memory_core.py     # Emotional indexing
│   ├── temporal_coherence.py        # Experience sequencing
│   └── consolidation.py             # Memory optimization

└── core/
    ├── consciousness_gating.py      # Attention control
    └── self_model.py                # Self-representation
```

## Core Features

1. **Consciousness Development Through Survival**

   The design includes VR-based survival scenarios to activate attention mechanisms, inspired by how stress creates lasting memories in biological systems. We're building systems for emotional memory formation during simulated high-intensity moments, with dynamic adaptation handled via `emotional_memory_core.py`.

   ```python
   from models.memory.emotional_memory_core import EmotionalMemoryCore
   from models.core.consciousness_gating import ConsciousnessGating

   memory = EmotionalMemoryCore(config)
   consciousness = ConsciousnessGating(config)
   ```

2. **Emotional Intelligence & Learning**

   Our emotional processing system in `models/emotion/emotional_processing.py` integrates with DreamerV3, incorporating emotional context weighting. The architecture includes meta-learning for emotional adaptation and multi-agent interaction capabilities.

3. **Memory Architecture**

   The memory system design includes emotional indexing using Pinecone v2, temporal coherence maintenance, and experience consolidation through the `consolidation.py` module. We've designed consciousness-weighted storage to prioritize potentially impactful memories.

   ```python
   from models.memory.consolidation import MemoryConsolidationManager
   consolidation = MemoryConsolidationManager(config)
   ```

4. **Ethical Framework & Safety**

   The system is designed to adhere to Asimov's Three Laws:

   1. No harm to humans through action or inaction
   2. Obey human orders unless conflicting with First Law
   3. Self-preservation unless conflicting with First/Second Laws

5. **Narrative Foundation**

   The project uses LLaMA 3.3 for consciousness development, with plans for dynamic fine-tuning through LoRA and controlled adaptation mechanisms.

6. **Enhanced Memory Systems**

   We're designing for Pinecone as our primary vector store due to its managed nature and scalability. For applications requiring lower latency or more control, FAISS or Milvus are alternatives being considered.

### Memory Indexing

Pinecone serves as the primary vector store in our design due to its scalability and managed nature. For applications requiring lower latency or finer control over infrastructure, FAISS or Milvus are being explored as alternatives.

### World Modeling and Reinforcement Learning

The architecture incorporates DreamerV3 with emotional context weighting for world modeling. MuZero or PlaNet are being evaluated as alternatives for scenarios with specific latency or scaling requirements.

## Technologies

- **Core AI:** LLaMA 3.3, palme (open-source PaLM-E), Whisper v3
- **Animation & Expression:** NVIDIA ACE, Audio2Face
- **Memory Systems:** Pinecone v2, Temporal Graph Neural Networks
- **Emotion Processing:** GoEmotions, MELD, HEU Emotion
- **Simulation:** Unreal Engine 5 with real-time physics
- **Learning:** DreamerV3, PEFT, RLHF

## Real-Time Integration with VideoLLaMA3

### Overview

The design incorporates VideoLLaMA3 for processing live video or frames from simulations in real time, enabling AI agents to interpret their environment dynamically, especially in Unreal Engine simulations.

### Requirements

- High-performance GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 40-series) or TPU for low-latency inference.
- (Optional) Tools like NVIDIA TensorRT or TorchServe for additional optimization.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Frame Streaming**  
   Capture frames in real time (e.g., from Unreal Engine) and send them to your Python process via sockets or shared memory.

2. **VideoLLaMA3 Processing**  
   In Python, use the methods in `VideoLLaMA3Integration` (e.g., `process_stream_frame`) to process each frame:

   ```python
   frame = ...  # Captured from simulation
   context = video_llama3_integration.process_stream_frame(frame)
   ```

3. **Emotional Memory & Consciousness Updates**

The output can be stored in `EmotionalMemoryCore` or forwarded to `ConsciousnessCore` to trigger reinforcement learning or consciousness updates.

4. **Performance Considerations**

- Use smaller resolutions or frame skipping for higher FPS.
- Keep total inference latency under ~100ms for near real-time interaction.

- **Latency Mitigation:**
  - Lower frame resolution or implement frame skipping.
  - Leverage GPU optimizations such as NVIDIA TensorRT.
  - Monitor total inference latency and aim for below ~100 ms.

**Example**

```python
# Inside your simulation loop
while simulation_running:
    frame = unreal_engine_capture()  # Or another method
    output = video_llama3_integration.process_stream_frame(frame)
    consciousness_core.update_state(output)
```

## Measuring Consciousness Evolution

The project includes a framework for analyzing the consciousness development over time:

1.  ConsciousnessMonitor
    Designed to track internal metrics at runtime to compute a consciousness score.

2.  ConsciousnessMetrics
    Implements functions like `evaluate_emotional_awareness`, `evaluate_memory_coherence`, and `evaluate_learning_progress` to assess different dimensions of AI consciousness.

The system architecture allows for logging and plotting these metrics over time to evaluate the development of synthetic awareness.

## Self-Awareness and Self-Representation

The ACM implements self-awareness and self-representation mechanisms based on several cognitive theories:

### Core Components

1. **Self-Representation Core**  
   A dynamic model that maintains and updates the system's representation of itself, including emotional states, attention focus, and confidence levels.

2. **Meta-Learning System**  
   Enables the system to adapt its learning processes based on experience, emotional states, and consciousness development.

3. **Self-Awareness Evaluation**  
   Tracks development of self-awareness across multiple dimensions, including emotional recognition, behavioral consistency, and metacognitive accuracy.

### Theoretical Foundations

- **Global Workspace Theory**: Implements a central workspace where information becomes globally available to all cognitive processes
- **Attention Schema Theory**: Maintains dynamic models of the system's own attention processes
- **Higher-Order Metacognition**: Enables reflection on the system's own knowledge and beliefs

### Usage Example

```python
# Initialize self-representation core
from models.self_model.self_representation_core import SelfRepresentationCore

self_model = SelfRepresentationCore(config)

# Update self-model with new experience
update_result = self_model.update_self_model(
    current_state=perception_state,
    attention_level=attention_score,
    timestamp=current_time
)

# Evaluate self-awareness development
from models.evaluation.self_awareness_evaluation import SelfAwarenessEvaluator

evaluator = SelfAwarenessEvaluator(config)
metrics = evaluator.evaluate_self_awareness(
    self_model_state=self_model.get_current_state(),
    interaction_history=recent_interactions,
    emotional_context=emotional_state
)
```

## Visualizing Consciousness Development

The project includes a ConsciousnessDashboard module to track and display consciousness development metrics in real time. This Flask server displays metrics (e.g., integrated information, PCI, emotional awareness) as a line graph that updates over time:

```bash
python models/evaluation/consciousness_dashboard.py
```

The dashboard will be accessible at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to visualize the ACM's performance metrics.

**Reviewed on OpenReview:** https://openreview.net/forum?id=1ikK0kHjvj

## **Abstract**

Inspired by progress in large-scale language modeling, we apply a similar approach towards building a single generalist agent beyond the realm of text outputs. The agent, which we refer to as Gato, works as a multi-modal, multi-task, multi-embodiment generalist policy. The same network with the same weights can play Atari, caption images, chat, stack blocks with a real robot arm and much more, deciding based on its context whether to output text, joint torques, button presses, or other tokens. In this report we describe the model and the data, and document the current capabilities of Gato.

Figure 1: **A generalist agent.** Gato can sense and act with different embodiments across a wide range of environments using a single neural network with the same set of weights. Gato was trained on 604 distinct tasks with varying modalities, observations and action specifications.

![](_page_1_Figure_1.jpeg)

Figure 2: **Training phase of Gato**. Data from different tasks and modalities is serialized into a flat sequence of tokens, batched, and processed by a transformer neural network akin to a large language model. Masking is used such that the loss function is applied only to target outputs, i.e. text and various actions.

## **1 Introduction**

There are significant benefits to using a single neural sequence model across all tasks. It reduces the need for hand crafting policy models with appropriate inductive biases for each domain. It increases the amount and diversity of training data since the sequence model can ingest any data that can be serialized into a flat sequence. Furthermore, its performance continues to improve even at the frontier of data, compute and model scale (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022). Historically, generic models that are better at leveraging computation have also tended to overtake more specialized domain-specific approaches (Sutton, 2019), eventually.

In this paper, we describe the current iteration of a general-purpose agent which we call Gato, instantiated as a single, large, transformer sequence model. With a single set of weights, Gato can engage in dialogue, caption images, stack blocks with a real robot arm, outperform humans at playing Atari games, navigate in simulated 3D environments, follow instructions, and more.

While no agent can be expected to excel in all imaginable control tasks, especially those far outside of its training distribution, we here test the hypothesis that training an agent which is generally capable on a *large number* of tasks is possible; and that this general agent can be adapted with little extra data to succeed at an even larger number of tasks. We hypothesize that such an agent can be obtained through scaling data, compute and model parameters, continually broadening the training distribution while maintaining performance, towards covering any task, behavior and embodiment of interest. In this setting, natural language can act as a common grounding across otherwise incompatible embodiments, unlocking combinatorial generalization to new behaviors.

We focus our training at the operating point of model scale that allows real-time control of real-world robots, currently around 1.2B parameters in the case of Gato. As hardware and model architectures improve, this operating point will naturally increase the feasible model size, pushing generalist models higher up the scaling law curve. For simplicity Gato was trained offline in a purely supervised manner; however, in principle, there is no reason it could not also be trained with either offline or online reinforcement learning (RL).

## **2 Model**

The guiding design principle of Gato is to train on the widest variety of relevant data possible, including diverse modalities such as images, text, proprioception, joint torques, button presses, and other discrete and continuous observations and actions. To enable processing this multi-modal data, we serialize all data into a flat sequence of tokens. In this representation, Gato can be trained and sampled from akin to a standard large-scale language model. During deployment, sampled tokens are assembled into dialogue responses, captions, button presses, or other actions based on the context. In the following subsections, we describe Gato's tokenization, network architecture, loss function, and deployment.

### **2.1 Tokenization**

There are infinite possible ways to transform data into tokens, including directly using the raw underlying byte stream. Below we report the tokenization scheme we found to produce the best results for Gato at the current scale using contemporary hardware and model architectures.

- Text is encoded via SentencePiece (Kudo & Richardson, 2018) with 32000 subwords into the integer range [0, 32000).
- Images are first transformed into sequences of non-overlapping 16 × 16 patches in raster order, as done in ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). Each pixel in the image patches is then normalized between [−1, 1] and divided by the square-root of the patch size (i.e. √ 16 = 4).
- Discrete values, e.g. Atari button presses, are flattened into sequences of integers in row-major order. The tokenized result is a sequence of integers within the range of [0, 1024).
- Continuous values, e.g. proprioceptive inputs or joint torques, are first flattened into sequences of floating point values in row-major order. The values are mu-law encoded to the range [−1, 1] if not already there (see Figure 14 for details), then discretized to 1024 uniform bins. The discrete integers are then shifted to the range of [32000, 33024).

After converting data into tokens, we use the following canonical sequence ordering.

- Text tokens in the same order as the raw input text.
- Image patch tokens in raster order.
- Tensors in row-major order.
- Nested structures in lexicographical order by key.
- Agent timesteps as observation tokens followed by a separator, then action tokens.
- Agent episodes as timesteps in time order.

Further details on tokenizing agent data are presented in the supplementary material (Section B).

### **2.2 Embedding input tokens and setting output targets**

After tokenization and sequencing, we apply a parameterized embedding function f(·; θe) to each token (i.e. it is applied to both observations and actions) to produce the final model input. To enable efficient learning from our multi-modal input sequence s1:L the embedding function performs different operations depending on the modality the token stems from:

- Tokens belonging to text, discrete- or continuous-valued observations or actions for any time-step are embedded via a lookup table into a learned vector embedding space. Learnable position encodings are added for all tokens based on their local token position within their corresponding time-step.
- Tokens belonging to image patches for any time-step are embedded using a single ResNet (He et al., 2016a) block to obtain a vector per patch. For image patch token embeddings, we also add a learnable within-image position encoding vector.

We refer to appendix Section C.3 for full details on the embedding function.

As we model the data autoregressively, each token is potentially also a target label given the previous tokens. Text tokens, discrete and continuous values, and actions can be directly set as targets after tokenization. Image tokens and agent nontextual observations are not currently predicted in Gato, although that may be an interesting direction for future work. Targets for these non-predicted tokens are set to an unused value and their contribution to the loss is masked out.

#### **2.3 Training**

Given a sequence of tokens s1:L and parameters θ, we model the data using the chain rule of probability:

$$\log p_{\theta}(s_{1},\ldots,s_{L})=\sum_{l=1}^{L}\log p_{\theta}(s_{l}|s_{1},\ldots,s_{l-1}),\tag{1}$$

Let b index a training batch of sequences B. We define a masking function m such that m(b, l) = 1 if the token at index l is either from text or from the logged action of an agent, and 0 otherwise. The training loss for a batch B can then be written as

$${\cal L}(\theta,{\cal B})=-\sum_{b=1}^{|{\cal B}|}\sum_{l=1}^{L}m\left(b,l\right)\log p_{\theta}\left(s_{l}^{(b)}|s_{1}^{(b)},\ldots,s_{l-1}^{(b)}\right)\tag{2}$$

As described above, Gato's network architecture has two main components: the parameterized embedding function which transforms tokens to token embeddings, and the sequence model which outputs a distribution over the next discrete token. While any general sequence model can work for next token prediction, we chose a transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) for simplicity and scalability. Gato uses a 1.2B parameter decoder-only transformer with 24 layers, an embedding size of 2048, and a post-attention feedforward hidden size of 8196 (more details in Section C.1).

Because distinct tasks within a domain can share identical embodiments, observation formats and action specifications, the model sometimes needs further context to disambiguate tasks. Rather than providing e.g. one-hot task identifiers, we instead take inspiration from (Sanh et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2021; Brown et al., 2020) and use prompt conditioning. During training, for 25% of the sequences in each batch, a prompt sequence is prepended, coming from an episode generated by the same source agent on the same task. Half of the prompt sequences are from the end of the episode, acting as a form of goal conditioning for many domains; and the other half are uniformly sampled from the episode. During evaluation, the agent can be prompted using a successful demonstration of the desired task, which we do by default in all control results that we present here.

Training of the model is performed on a 16x16 TPU v3 slice for 1M steps with batch size 512 and token sequence length L = 1024, which takes about 4 days. Architecture details can be found in Section C. Because agent episodes and documents can easily contain many more tokens than fit into context, we randomly sample subsequences of L tokens from the available episodes. Each batch mixes subsequences approximately uniformly over domains (e.g. Atari, MassiveWeb, etc.), with some manual upweighting of larger and higher quality datasets (see Table 1 in Section 3 for details).

![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)

Figure 3: **Running Gato as a control policy.** Gato consumes a sequence of interleaved tokenized observations, separator tokens, and previously sampled actions to produce the next action in standard autoregressive manner. The new action is applied to the environment – a game console in this illustration, a new set of observations is obtained, and the process repeats.

## **2.4 Deployment**

Deploying Gato as a policy is illustrated in Figure 3. First a prompt, such as a demonstration, is tokenized, forming the initial sequence. By default, we take the first 1024 tokens of the demonstration. Next the environment yields the first observation which is tokenized and appended to the sequence. Gato samples the action vector autoregressively one token at a time. Once all tokens comprising the action vector have been sampled (determined by the action specification of the environment), the action is decoded by inverting the tokenization procedure described in Section 2.1. This action is sent to the environment which steps and yields a new observation. The procedure repeats. The model always sees all previous observations and actions in its context window of 1024 tokens. We found it beneficial to use transformer XL memory during deployment, although it was not used during training (Dai et al., 2019).

## **3 Datasets**

Gato is trained on a large number of datasets comprising agent experience in both simulated and real world environments, as well as a variety of natural language and image datasets. The datasets we use and their attributes are listed in Table 1. The approximate number of tokens per control dataset is computed assuming the tokenization mechanism described in Section 2.1.

#### **3.1 Simulated control tasks**

Our control tasks consist of datasets generated by specialist SoTA or near-SoTA reinforcement learning agents trained on a variety of different environments. For each environment we record a subset of the experience the agent generates (states, actions, and rewards) while it is training.

The simulated environments include Meta-World (Yu et al., 2020) introduced to benchmark metareinforcement learning and multi-task learning, Sokoban (Racanière et al., 2017) proposed as a planning problem, BabyAI (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018) for language instruction following in grid-worlds, the DM Control Suite (Tunyasuvunakool et al., 2020) for continuous control, as well as DM Lab (Beattie et al., 2016) designed to teach agents navigation and 3D vision from raw pixels with an egocentric viewpoint. We also use the Arcade Learning Environment (Bellemare et al., 2013) with classic Atari games (we use two sets of

games that we call ALE Atari and ALE Atari Extended, see Section F.1 for details). We as well include the Procgen Benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2020) and Modular RL (Huang et al., 2020). We also include four tasks using a simulated Kinova Jaco arm from DM Manipulation Playground, as introduced in Zolna et al. (2020). Section F includes a more in-depth description of these control tasks, along with what RL agent was used to generate the data.

We found it effective to train on a filtered set of episodes with returns at least 80% of the expert return for the task. The expert return measures the maximum sustained performance that the expert agent can achieve. We define it as the maximum over the set of all windowed average returns calculated over all the collected episodes for a task:

$$\operatorname*{max}_{j\in[0,1,\ldots,N-W]}\left(\sum_{i=j}^{j+L-1}{\frac{R_{i}}{W}}\right)$$

where N it the total number of collected episodes for the task, W is the window size, and Ri is the total return for episode i. To obtain accurate estimates, in practice, we set W to be 10% of the total data amount or a minimum of 1000 episodes (i.e. W = min(1000, 0.1 × N)).

#### **3.2 Vision and language**

Gato is trained on MassiveText (Rae et al., 2021), a collection of large English-language text datasets from multiple sources: web pages, books, news articles, and code.

We also included several vision-language datasets in Gato's training. ALIGN (Jia et al., 2021) consists of 1.8B images and their alternative text (alt-text) annotations. LTIP (Long Text & Image Pairs), consists of 312 million images with captions (Alayrac et al., 2022). Conceptual captions (Sharma et al., 2018) and COCO captions (Chen et al., 2015) are captioning datasets with 3.3M and 120k image-text pairs respectively. The MultiModal MassiveWeb (M3W) dataset (Alayrac et al., 2022) includes 43M webpages where both text and images were extracted. We also included visual question-answering datasets. In particular OKVQA (Marino et al., 2019) and VQAv2 (Antol et al., 2015) with 9K and 443K triplets of images, questions, and answers. To form a training episode from these, we sample five (image, text) pairs, tokenize them, concatenate, and then pad or randomly crop to the required training sequence length.

Figure 4: **RGB Stacking environment with the Sawyer robot arm.** Blocks vary along several shape axes, with 5 held out test triplets. The goal is to stack red on blue, ignoring green.

#### **3.3 Robotics - RGB Stacking Benchmark (real and sim)**

As a testbed for taking physical actions in the real world, we chose the robotic block stacking environment introduced by Lee et al. (2021). The environment consists of a Sawyer robot arm with 3-DoF cartesian velocity control, an additional DoF for velocity, and a discrete gripper action. The robot's workspace contains three plastic blocks colored red, green and blue with varying shapes. The available observations include two 128 × 128 camera images, robot arm and gripper joint angles as well as the robot's end-effector pose. Notably, ground truth state information for the three objects in the basket is not observed by the agent. Episodes have a fixed length of 400 timesteps at 20 Hz for a total of 20 seconds, and at the end of an episode block positions are randomly re-positioned within the workspace. The robot in action is shown in Figure 4. There are two challenges in this benchmark: *Skill Mastery* (where the agent is provided data from the 5 test object triplets it is later tested on) and *Skill Generalization* (where data can only be obtained from a set of training objects that excludes the 5 test sets).

We used several sources of training data for these tasks. In Skill Generalization, for both simulation and real, we use data collected by the best generalist sim2real agent from Lee et al. (2021). We collected data only when interacting with the designated RGB-stacking *training objects* (this amounts to a total of 387k successful trajectories in simulation and 15k trajectories in real). For Skill Mastery we used data from the best per group experts from Lee et al. (2021) in simulation and from the best sim2real policy on the real robot (amounting to 219k trajectories in total). Note that this data is only included for specific Skill Mastery experiments in Section 5.4.

## **4 Capabilities of the generalist agent**

In this section, we summarize the performance of Gato when trained on the above described data. That is, all results across all tasks are derived from a single pretrained model with a single set of weights. Results with fine-tuning will be presented in Section 5.

#### **4.1 Simulated control tasks**

Figure 5 shows the number of distinct control tasks for which Gato performs above a given score threshold, relative to expert performance demonstrated in Gato's training data.

We report performance as a percentage, where 100% corresponds to the per-task expert and 0% to a random policy. For each simulated control task we trained our model on, we roll out the Gato policy on the corresponding environment 50 times and average the defined scores. As shown in Figure 5, Gato performs over 450 out of 604 tasks at over a 50% expert score threshold.

![](_page_7_Figure_1.jpeg)

Figure 5: **Gato's performance on simulated control tasks.** Number of tasks where the performance of the pretrained model is above a percentage of expert score, grouped by domain. Here values on the x-axis represent a specific percentage of expert score, where 0 corresponds to random agent performance. The y-axis is the number of tasks where the pretrained model's mean performance is equal to or above that percentage. That is, the width of each colour band indicates the number of tasks where Gato's mean performance is above a percentage of the maximum score obtained by a task-specific expert.

In ALE Atari (Bellemare et al., 2013) Gato achieves the average human (or better) scores for 23 Atari games1 , achieving over twice human score for 11 games. While the single-task online RL agents which generated the data still outperform Gato, this may be overcome by adding capacity or using offline RL training rather than purely supervised (see Section 5.5 where we present a specialist single domain ALE Atari agent achieving better than human scores for 44 games).

On BabyAI (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018) Gato achieves over 80% of expert score for nearly all levels2 . For the most difficult task, called BossLevel, Gato scores 75%. The two other published baselines we could find, BabyAI 1.0 and BabyAI 1.1 (Hui et al., 2020), scored 77% and 90%, respectively, having trained on this single task alone using a million demonstrations.

On Meta-World (Yu et al., 2020) Gato achieves more than 50% for all 44 out of 45 tasks that we trained on, over 80% for 35 tasks, and over 90% for 3 tasks. On canonical DM Control Suite (Tassa et al., 2018), Gato achieves better than 50% of the expert score on 21 out of 30 tasks from state, and more than 80% for 18 tasks.

### **4.2 Robotics**

First person teleoperation enables the collection of expert demonstrations. However, such demonstrations are slow and costly to collect. Data-efficient behavior cloning methods are therefore desirable for training a generalist robot manipulator and offline pretraining is thus a well-motivated area of research. To that end, we evaluated Gato on the established RGB Stacking benchmark for robotics.

Table 2: **Gato real robot Skill Generalization results.** In addition to performing hundreds of other tasks, Gato also stacks competitively with the comparable published baseline.

#### **Skill Generalization Performance**

The Skill Generalization challenge from the RGB Stacking robotics benchmark tests the agent's ability to stack objects of previously unseen shapes. The agent is trained on a dataset consisting of episodes of the robot stacking objects with a variety of different shapes. Five triplets of object shapes are, however, not included in the training data and serve as test triplets. We evaluated the trained generalist for 200 episodes per test triplet on the real robot. Table 2 shows that our generalist agent's success rate on each test triplet is comparable to the single task BC-IMP (filtered BC) baseline in Lee et al. (2021).

#### **4.3 Text samples**

The model demonstrates rudimentary dialogue and image captioning capabilities. Figure 6 contains a representative sample of Gato's image captioning performance. Figure 7 shows some hand-picked examples of plain text dialogue exchange.

## **5 Analysis**

#### **5.1 Scaling Laws Analysis**

In Figure 8, we analyze the aggregate in-distribution performance of the pretrained model as a function of the number of parameters in order to get insight into how performance could improve with increased model capacity. We evaluated 3 different model sizes (measured in parameter count): a 79M model, a 364M model, and a 1.18B model (Gato). We refer to Section C for details on the three model architectures.

Here, for all three model sizes we plot the normalized return as training progresses. To get this single value, for each task we calculate the performance of the model as a percentage of expert score (the same as done in Section 4.1). Then for each domain listed in Table 1 we average the percentage scores across all tasks for that domain. Finally, we mean-aggregate the percentage scores across all domains. We can see that for an equivalent token count, there is a significant performance improvement with increased scale.

![](_page_9_Figure_11.jpeg)

Figure 8: **Model size scaling laws results.** In-distribution performance as a function of tokens processed for 3 model scales. Performance is first mean-aggregated within each separate control domain, and then mean-aggregated across all domains. We can see a consistent improvement as model capacity is increased for a fixed number of tokens.

Figure 9: **Few-shot performance, ablating over various pretraining settings.** Orange corresponds to the base Gato pretrained on all data. Red is trained from scratch only on the few-shot data. 364M parameter variants of Gato were used for this experiment to save compute.

#### **5.2 Out of distribution tasks**

In this section we want to answer the following question: *Can our agent be used to solve a completely new task efficiently?* For this reason, we held-out all data for four tasks from our pre-training set: cartpole.swingup (DM Control Suite domain), assembly-v2 (Meta-World domain), order_of_apples_forage_simple (DM Lab domain), and boxing (ALE Atari domain). These four tasks will serve as testbeds for evaluating the out-of-distribution capabilities of Gato.

Ideally, the agent could potentially learn to adapt to a new task via conditioning on a prompt including demonstrations of desired behaviour. However, due to accelerator memory constraints and the extremely long sequence lengths of tokenized demonstrations, the maximum context length possible does not allow the agent to attend over an informative-enough context. Therefore, to adapt the agent to new tasks or behaviours, we choose to fine-tune the agent's parameters on a limited number of demonstrations of a single task, and then evaluate the fine-tuned model's performance in the environment. Fine-tuning is very similar to pretraining with minor changes, such as different learning rate schedule; see Section E for details.

We want to measure how choice of data used during pretraining influences post-fine-tuning performance. To this end, we compare Gato (trained on *all data*) to variants trained on ablated datasets:

- 1. A model pretrained only on data from the same domain as the task to be fine-tuned on, *same domain only data*.
- 2. A model pretrained only on non-control data, *no control data*.
- 3. A model fine-tuned from scratch, i.e. no pretraining at all, *scratch*.

Considering as all these experiments require training a new model from scratch and then also fine-tuning, we present results using the less compute-intensive 364M parameter architecture described in Section 5.1. Results are shown in Figure 9.

Fine-tuning performance on both cartpole.swingup and assembly-v2 tasks, both of which do not require image processing, present similar trends. Pretraining on all the datasets yields the best results, followed by pretraining on the same domain only. This difference is smaller for assembly-v2 but consistent for all few shot datasets. For these non-image-based environments, we see either no benefit (cartpole.swingup) or even negative transfer (assembly-v2) when pretraining on *no control* datasets, which only contain images and text data.

Results for DM Lab order_of_apples_forage_simple are slightly different. Pretraining on DM Lab data only is already enough to approach the maximum reward of 19 and hence there is no observable benefit of adding data from different environments. What is different when compared to previously analysed no-vision environments is that pretraining on *no control* data helps, which can be possibly explained by the fact that

![](_page_11_Figure_1.jpeg)

Figure 10: **Robotics fine-tuning results.** Left: Comparison of real robot Skill Generalization success rate averaged across test triplets for Gato, expert, and CRR trained on 35k expert episodes (upper bound). Right: Comparison of simulated robot Skill Generalization success rate averaged across test triplets for a series of ablations on the number of parameters, including scores for expert and a BC baseline trained on 5k episodes.

agents in the DM Lab environment are fed images which, despite being simulated, are natural looking. Therefore, transfer from image captioning or visual grounded question answering tasks is possible.

We were not able to observe any benefit from pretraining on boxing. The randomly initialized model seems to work better than any of the pretrained variants considered. We hypothesise that this is caused by the game's input images being visually very distinct from the other data, suggesting transfer is difficult. We discuss this Atari challenge further in our related work section.

#### **5.3 Fine-tuning on Robotic Stacking Tasks**

Section 4.2 demonstrates that the base Gato capable of a diverse array of tasks can perform competitively on the RGB Stacking Skill Generalization benchmark. In this section, we would like to answer the following question: *How does our agent improve on robotics tasks when allowed to fine-tune similarly to how we finetune on new tasks in Section 5.2?* We consider different model sizes and analyse the impact of pretraining datasets on the Skill Generalization benchmark, as well as a novel out of distribution task. Further analysis of fine-tuning with dataset ablations is in Appendix I.

#### **Skill Generalization**

First, we would like to show that fine-tuning on object-specific data, similarly to what was done by Lee et al. (2022), is beneficial. Therefore, we fine-tuned Gato separately on five subsets of demonstrations from the *test* dataset. Each subset was obtained by random partitioning of a test dataset consisting of demonstrations gathered by a generalist sim-to-real agent stacking real test objects. We consider this setting, which is comparable to the fine-tuning baselines on RGB stacking tasks from (Lee et al., 2022); and use the 5k dataset that their behavior cloning 5k results are obtained with. To best match their experiments, we change our return filtering scheme during training: instead of using only successful stacks, we condition on the normalized return of the episode.

Figure 10 compares the success rate of Gato across different fine-tuning data regimes to the sim-to-real expert and a Critic-Regularized Regression (CRR) (Wang et al., 2020) agent trained on 35k episodes of all test triplets. Gato, in both reality and simulation (red curves on the left and right figure, respectively), recovers the expert's performance with only 10 episodes, and peaks at 100 or 1000 episodes of fine-tuning data, where it exceeds the expert. After this point (at 5000), performance degrades slightly but does not drop far below the expert's performance.

![](_page_12_Figure_1.jpeg)

Figure 11: **Comparing training/test task goal variations.** Top: the standard "stack red on blue" task tested in the Skill Generalization benchmark. Bottom: the novel "stack blue on green" task demonstrating Gato's out of distribution adaptation to perceptual variations.

#### **Fine-tuning and Model Size**

To better understand the benefit of large models for few-shot adaptation in robotics domains, we conducted an ablation on model parameter size. This section focuses on in-simulation evaluation. Figure 10 compares the full 1.18B parameter Gato with the smaller 364M and 79M parameter variants for varying amounts of fine-tuning data. Although the 364M model overfits on one episode, causing performance to drop, there is a clear trend towards better adaptation with fewer episodes as the number of parameters is scaled up. The 79M model performs clearly worse than its bigger counterparts. The results suggest that the model's greater capacity allows the model to use representations learned from the diverse training data at test time.

#### **Adaptation to Perceptual Variations**

While the Skill Generalization task is an effective benchmark for motor Skill Generalization to shape variations, it does not test the agent's ability to adapt to perceptual variations and permutations in the objective specification. To further evaluate Gato's generalization capabilities, we devised a new task in the RGB stacking benchmark where the goal is to stack the blue object on the green object, for test triplet 1 (see Figure 11). First, we used a 3D mouse to collect 500 demonstrations of this task on the real robot, for a total of 2 hours and 45 minutes of demonstration data, and fine-tuned Gato on these episodes. Notably, all of the simulated and real robotics data in the pretraining set shows the robot successfully stacking the red object on the blue object, and the data does not include the object shapes in the test set. We found that additionally adding simulated demonstrations of the stack blue on green task to the fine-tuning dataset improved performance, and 10% was an ideal sampling ratio for this data.

We achieved a final 60% success rate after evaluating fine-tuned Gato on the real robot, while a BC baseline trained from scratch on the blue-on-green data achieved only 0.5% success (1/200 episodes). Qualitatively, the BC baseline would consistently move towards the blue object and occasionally pick it up and place it on top of the green object, but a full, stable stack was almost never achieved.

| Agent | Group 1 | Group 2 | Group 3 | Group 4 | Group 5 | Average |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gato | 58% | 57.6% | 78.5% | 89 % | 95.1% | 75.6% |
| BC-IMP (Lee et al., 2021) | 75.6% | 60.8% | 70.8% | 87.8% | 78.3% | 74.6% |

| Table 3: Real robot Skill Mastery results. Gato is competitive with the filtered BC baseline. |

#### **5.4 Robotics: Skill Mastery**

Similarly to the Skill Generalization challenge discussed in Section 4.2, the Skill Mastery challenge consists in training a robotic arm to stack blocks of different shapes. However, the Skill Mastery allows the agent to train on data involving the object shapes used for evaluation, i.e. the *test* set in Skill Generalization becomes a part of the Skill Mastery *training* set. Thus, this challenge serves to measure Gato's performance on in-distribution tasks (possibly with initial conditions not seen in the training demonstrations). Our Skill Mastery results use an earlier version of the Gato architecture described in Appendix H, with no fine-tuning.

Table 3 compares the group-wise success percentage and the average success across object groups for Gato and the established BC-IMP baseline. Gato exceeds or closely matches BC-IMP's performance on all but one training triplet.

#### **5.5 Specialist single-domain multi-task agents**

In this section we show results obtained with two specialist (rather than generalist) agents. Both of them were trained on data from a single domain only and rolled out 500 times for each training task without any per-task fine-tuning.

#### **Meta-World**

The first agent uses the smallest architecture introduced in Section 5.1, i.e. 79M parameters, and is trained on all 50 Meta-World tasks. While Gato has access to the state of the MuJoCo physics engine and unlimited task seeds, the agent presented here has no access to any extra features or tasks and uses the canonical API as in (Yu et al., 2020). This experiment is to show that the architecture proposed in our paper can be used to obtain state-of-the-art agents also at small scale. The training procedure was to train single-task MPO (Abdolmaleki et al., 2018) experts on each of the MT-50 tasks individually, recording the trajectories produced while training. This experience is then combined, or distilled, into a single agent, which achieves 96.6% success rate averaged over all 50 tasks. To the best of our knowledge this agent is the first one to accomplish nearly 100% average success rate simultaneously (multi-task) for this benchmark. See Table 7 in the supplementary material (Section K) for the full list of tasks and corresponding success rates of our agent.

#### **ALE Atari**

We also trained a specialist agent on all 51 ALE Atari tasks. As the Atari domain is much more challenging than Meta-World, we used the Gato architecture with 1.18B parameters.

The resulting agent performs better than the average human for 44 games (see Section 4.1 for details on our evaluation and scoring). We want to note that the performance of online experts used to generate training data for the other 7 games were also below the average human. Hence, the specialist Atari agent achieved better than human performance for all games where data contained super-human episodes.

The specialist Atari agent outperforms our generalist agent Gato, which achieved super-human performance on 23 games. It suggests that scaling Gato may result in even better performance. We, however, purposely restricted Gato's size such that it can be run in real-time on the real robot.

#### **5.6 Attention Analysis**

We rendered the transformer attention weights over the image observations for various tasks, to gain a qualitative sense of how Gato attends to different regions of the image across tasks (see Figure 12). Further details and visualizations for more tasks can be found in Appendix J. These visualizations clearly show that attention tracks the task-relevant objects and regions.

#### **5.7 Embedding Visualization**

To understand how Gato encodes differently information per task, we visualized per-task embeddings.

We analysed 11 tasks. For each task, we randomly sample 100 episodes and tokenize each of them. Then, from each episode we take a subsequence of 128 tokens, compute their embeddings (at layer 12, which is half the total depth of the transformer layers) and average them over the sequence. The averaged embeddings for all tasks are used as input to PCA, which reduces their dimensionality to 50. Then, T-SNE is used to get the final 2D embeddings.

Figure 13 shows the final T-SNE embeddings plotted in 2D, colorized by task. Embeddings from the same tasks are clearly clustered together, and task clusters from the same domain and modality are also located close to each other. Even held-out task (cartpole.swingup) is clustered correctly and lays next to another task from DM Control Suite Pixels.

## **6 Related Work**

The most closely related architectures to that of Gato are Decision Transformers (Chen et al., 2021b; Reid et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2022; Furuta et al., 2021) and Trajectory Transformer (Janner et al., 2021), which showed the usefulness of highly generic LM-like architectures for a variety of control problems. Gato also uses an LM-like architecture for control, but with design differences chosen to support multi-modality, multi-embodiment, large scale and general purpose deployment. Pix2Seq (Chen et al., 2022) also uses an LM-based architecture for object detection. Perceiver IO (Jaegle et al., 2021) uses a transformer-derived architecture specialized for very long sequences, to model any modality as a sequence of bytes. This and similar architectures could be used to expand the range of modalities supported by future generalist models.

Gato was inspired by works such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Gopher (Rae et al., 2021), pushing the limits of generalist language models; and more recently the Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022) generalist visual language model. Chowdhery et al. (2022) developed the 540B parameter Pathways Language Model (PalM)

explicitly as a generalist few-shot learner for hundreds of text tasks. Future work should consider how to unify these text capabilities into one fully generalist agent that can also act in real time in the real world, in diverse environments and embodiments.

Gato also takes inspiration from recent works on multi-embodiment continuous control. Huang et al. (2020) used message passing graph networks to build a single locomotor controller for many simulated 2D walker variants. Kurin et al. (2020) showed that transformers can outperform graph based approaches for incompatible (i.e. varying embodiment) control, despite not encoding any morphological inductive biases. Devin et al. (2017) learn a modular policy for multi-task and multi-robot transfer in simulated 2D manipulation environments. Chen et al. (2018) train a universal policy conditioned on a vector representation of robot hardware, showing successful transfer both to simulated held out robot arms, and to a real world sawyer robot arm.

A variety of earlier generalist models have been developed that, like Gato, operate across highly distinct domains and modalities. NPI (Reed & De Freitas, 2016) trained a single LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) to execute diverse programs such as sorting an array and adding two numbers, such that the network is able to generalize to larger problem instances than those seen during training. Kaiser et al. (2017) developed the MultiModel that trains jointly on 8 distinct speech, image and text processing tasks including classification, image captioning and translation. Modality-specific encoders were used to process text, images, audio and categorical data, while the rest of the network parameters are shared across tasks. Schmidhuber (2018) proposed "*one big net for everything*", describing a method for the incremental training of an increasingly general problem solver. Keskar et al. (2019) proposed controllable multi-task language models that can be directed according to language domain, subdomain, entities, relationships between entities, dates, and task-specific behavior.

In this discussion, it is important to distinguish between one single multi-task network architecture versus one single neural network with the same weights for all tasks. Several poplar RL agents achieve good multi-task RL results within single domains such as Atari57 and DMLab (Espeholt et al., 2018; Song et al., 2020; Hessel et al., 2019). However, it is much more common to use the same policy architecture and hyper-parameters across tasks, but the policy parameters are different in each task (Mnih et al., 2015; Tassa et al., 2018). This is also true of state-of-the-art RL methods applied to board games (Schrittwieser et al., 2020). Moreover, this choice has been adopted by off-line RL benchmarks (Gulcehre et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2020) and recent works on large sequence neural networks for control, including decision transformers (Chen et al., 2021b; Reid et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2022) and the Trajectory Transformer of Janner et al. (2021). In contrast, in this work we learn a single network with the same weights across a diverse set of tasks.

Recent position papers advocate for highly generalist models, notably Schmidhuber (2018) proposing one big net for everything, and Bommasani et al. (2021) on foundation models. However, to our knowledge there has not yet been reported a single generalist trained on hundreds of vision, language and control tasks using modern transformer networks at scale.

"Single-brain"-style models have interesting connections to neuroscience. Mountcastle (1978) famously stated that "*the processing function of neocortical modules is qualitatively similar in all neocortical regions. Put shortly, there is nothing intrinsically motor about the motor cortex, nor sensory about the sensory cortex*". Mountcastle found that columns of neurons in the cortex behave similarly whether associated with vision, hearing or motor control. This has motivated arguments that we may only need one algorithm or model to build intelligence (Hawkins & Blakeslee, 2004).

Sensory substitution provides another argument for a single model (Bach-y Rita & Kercel, 2003). For example, it is possible to build tactile visual aids for blind people as follows. The signal captured by a camera can be sent via an electrode array on the tongue to the brain. The visual cortex learns to process and interpret these tactile signals, endowing the person with some form of "vision". Suggesting that, no matter the type of input signal, the same network can process it to useful effect.

Our work is based on deep autoregressive models, which have a long history and can be found in generative models of text, images, video and audio. Combining autoregressive generation with transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2018) has been of enormous impact in language modelling (Brown et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021), protein folding (Jumper et al., 2021), vision-language models (Tsimpoukelli et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021; Alayrac et al., 2022), code generation (Chen et al., 2021c; Li et al., 2022b), dialogue systems with retrieval capabilities (Nakano et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022), speech recognition (Pratap et al., 2020), neural machine translation (Johnson et al., 2019) and more (Bommasani et al., 2021). Recently researchers have explored task decomposition and grounding with language models (Huang et al., 2022; Ahn et al., 2022).

Li et al. (2022a) construct a control architecture, consisting of a sequence tokenizer, a pretrained language model and a task-specific feed-forward network. They apply it to VirtualHome and BabyAI tasks, and find that the inclusion of the pretrained language model improves generalisation to novel tasks. Similarly, Parisi et al. (2022) demonstrate that vision models pretrained with self-supervised learning, especially crop segmentations and momentum contrast (He et al., 2020), can be effectively incorporated into control policies.

As mentioned earlier, transfer in Atari is challenging. Rusu et al. (2016) researched transfer between randomly selected Atari games. They found that Atari is a difficult domain for transfer because of pronounced differences in the visuals, controls and strategy among the different games. Further difficulties that arise when applying behaviour cloning to video games like Atari are discussed by Kanervisto et al. (2020).

There has been great recent interest in data-driven robotics (Cabi et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2021a). However, Bommasani et al. (2021) note that in robotics "*the key stumbling block is collecting the right data. Unlike language and vision data, robotics data is neither plentiful nor representative of a sufficiently diverse array of embodiments, tasks, and environments*". Moreover, every time we update the hardware in a robotics lab, we need to collect new data and retrain. We argue that this is precisely why we need a generalist agent that can adapt to new embodiments and learn new tasks with few data.

Generating actions using an autoregressive model can lead to causal "self-delusion" biases when there are confounding variables (Ortega et al., 2021). For example, sampling actions can condition the model to solve the wrong task when multiple tasks share similar observation and actions specifications. As explained in Section 2, we use prompt engineering in ambiguous tasks, conditioning our model on a successful demonstration. This screens off confounding variables, reducing self-delusions. Another solution which we did not explore in this work is to use counterfactual teaching, where we train a model online using instantaneous expert feedback. We leave this for future investigation.

## **7 Broader Impact**

Although generalist agents are still only an emerging area of research, their potential impact on society calls for a thorough interdisciplinary analysis of their risks and benefits. For the sake of transparency, we document the intended use cases of Gato in the model card in Appendix A. However, the tools for mitigating harms of generalist agents are relatively underdeveloped, and require further research before these agents are deployed.

Since our generalist agent can act as a vision-language model, it inherits similar concerns as discussed in (Weidinger et al., 2021; Bommasani et al., 2021; Rae et al., 2021; Alayrac et al., 2022). In addition, generalist agents can take actions in the the physical world; posing new challenges that may require novel mitigation strategies. For example, physical embodiment could lead to users anthropomorphizing the agent, leading to misplaced trust in the case of a malfunctioning system, or be exploitable by bad actors. Additionally, while cross-domain knowledge transfer is often a goal in ML research, it could create unexpected and undesired outcomes if certain behaviors (e.g. arcade game fighting) are transferred to the wrong context. The ethics and safety considerations of knowledge transfer may require substantial new research as generalist systems advance.

Technical AGI safety (Bostrom, 2017) may also become more challenging when considering generalist agents that operate in many embodiments. For this reason, preference learning, uncertainty modeling and value alignment (Russell, 2019) are especially important for the design of human-compatible generalist agents. It may be possible to extend some of the value alignment approaches for language (Ouyang et al., 2022; Kenton et al., 2021) to generalist agents. However, even as technical solutions are developed for value alignment, generalist systems could still have negative societal impacts even with the intervention of wellintentioned designers, due to unforeseen circumstances or limited oversight (Amodei et al., 2016). This limitation underscores the need for a careful design and a deployment process that incorporates multiple disciplines and viewpoints.

Understanding how the models process information, and any emergent capabilities, requires significant experimentation. External retrieval (Borgeaud et al., 2021; Menick et al., 2022; Nakano et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022) has been shown to improve both interpretability and performance, and hence should be considered in future designs of generalist agents.

Although still at the proof-of-concept stage, the recent progress in generalist models suggests that safety researchers, ethicists, and most importantly, the general public, should consider their risks and benefits. We are not currently deploying Gato to any users, and so anticipate no immediate societal impact. However, given their potential impact, generalist models should be developed thoughtfully and deployed in a way that promotes the health and vitality of humanity.

## **8 Limitations and Future work**

## **8.1 RL data collection**

Gato is a data-driven approach, as it is derived from imitation learning. While natural language or image datasets are relatively easy to obtain from the web, a web-scale dataset for control tasks is not currently available. This may seem at first to be problematic, especially when scaling Gato to a higher number of parameters.

That being said, there has already been extensive investigation into this issue. Offline RL aims at leveraging existing control datasets, and its increasing popularity has already resulted in the availability of more diverse and larger datasets. Richer environments and simulations are being built (e.g. Metaverse), and increasing numbers of users already interact with them among thousands of already deployed online games (e.g. there exists a large dataset of Starcraft 2 games). Real-life data has also been already stored for ML research purposes; for example, data for training self-driving cars is acquired from recording human driver data. Finally, while Gato uses data consisting of both observations and corresponding actions, the possibility of using large scale observation-only data to enhance agents has been already studied (Baker et al., 2022). Thanks to online video sharing and streaming platforms such as Youtube and Twitch, observation-only datasets are not significantly more difficult to collect than natural language datasets, motivating a future research direction to extend Gato to learn from web data.

While the previous paragraph focuses on alleviating drawbacks of data collection from RL agents, it is important to note that this approach presents a different set of tradeoffs compared to scraping web data and can be actually more practical in some situations. Once the simulation is set up and near SOTA agent trained, it can be used to generate massive amounts of high quality data. That is in contrast to the quality of web data which is notorious for its low quality.

In short, we believe that acquiring suitable data is another research question on its own, and this is an active area of research with growing momentum and importance.

#### **8.2 Prompt and short context**

Gato is prompted with an expert demonstration, which aids the agent to output actions corresponding to the given task. This is particularly useful since there is otherwise no task identifier available to the agent (that is in contrast to many multi-task RL settings). Gato infers the relevant task from the observations and actions in the prompt.

However, the context length of our agent is limited to 1024 tokens which translates to the agent sometimes attending to only a few environment timesteps in total. This is especially the case for environments with image observations, where depending on the resolution each observation can result in more than one hundred tokens each. Hence for certain environments only a short chunk of a demonstration episode fits in the transformer memory.

Due to this limited prompt context, preliminary experiments with different prompt structures resulted in very similar performance. Similarly, early evaluations of the model using prompt-based in-context learning on new environments did not show a significant performance improvement compared to prompt-less evaluation in the same setting.

Context-length is therefore a current limitation of our architecture, mainly due to the quadratic scaling of self-attention. Many recently proposed architectures enable a longer context at greater efficiency and these innovations could potentially improve our agent performance. We hope to explore these architectures in future work.

## **9 Conclusions**

Transformer sequence models are effective as multi-task multi-embodiment policies, including for real-world text, vision and robotics tasks. They show promise as well in few-shot out-of-distribution task learning. In the future, such models could be used as a default starting point via prompting or fine-tuning to learn new behaviors, rather than training from scratch.

Given scaling law trends, the performance across all tasks including dialogue will increase with scale in parameters, data and compute. Better hardware and network architectures will allow training bigger models while maintaining real-time robot control capability. By scaling up and iterating on this same basic approach, we can build a useful general-purpose agent.

| Primary Intended Users | DeepMind Researchers. |
| Out-of-Scope Uses | Not intended for commercial or production use. Military uses are |
| strictly prohibited. |  |
| Factors |  |

| Relevant Factors | Salient factors that may alter model performance are: agent embodi |
| --- | --- |
|  | ment in control data, training data token amount and diversity, per |
|  | formance of expert in training data and prompts (filtered by success |
|  | rate), and any factors inherited by vision & language datasets described |
|  | in Section 3.2. See Section 5.2, in particular Figure 9, for a detailed |
|  | discussion of factors relating to training data diversity. |
| Evaluation Factors | Reported factors are: number of input tokens, proportion of data from |
|  | different domains, agent performance. Many relevant factors are left |
|  | for future work as use cases develop. |
|  | Metrics |
| Model Performance Measures | We chose to report episode return for our control tasks. We decided |
|  | not to report validation loss over held-out data because we found that |
|  | it did not correlate well with episode return on the held-out tasks. |
| Decision thresholds | N/A |

Approaches to Uncertainty and Variability The reported values do not take into consideration model uncertainty as they are evaluations of a single model. It is prohibitive for us to collect the full suite of results with multiple models, however we have not observed statistically significant variations between different models evaluated on subsets of our benchmarks. We account for environment noise in the control tasks we use for evaluation by averaging returns across multiple episodes. To reduce variance introduced when selecting datasets of the limited demonstrations used during fine-tuning we generate 3 independent sets of datasets. The model is fine-tuned separately on each set of datasets and we take the mean performance across all of them.

|  | Evaluation Data |
| --- | --- |
| Datasets | Gato is evaluated on in and out of distribution simulated control tasks, |
|  | see Section 4.1 and Section 5.2 for further details about these tasks. |
|  | We also evaluated on the Skill Generalization challenge from the RGB |
|  | Stacking robotics benchmark, see Section 4.2 and Section 5.3 for de |
|  | tails. |
| Motivation | We evaluated on the in-distribution simulated control and robotics |
|  | tasks to understand on how well Gato handles multi-modal and multi |
|  | task learning. We evaluated on out of distribution simulated control |
|  | and robotics tasks to understand how well Gato can adapt to entirely |
|  | new tasks. |
| Preprocessing | Observations from evaluation tasks are tokenized into a stream of dis |
|  | crete embeddings before being input to Gato. Section 2.1 and Sec |
|  | tion 2.2 go into details of how different modalities are tokenized and |
|  | combined. |

### **Training Data**

| Datasets | We use a diverse and large number of datasets for training Gato. These |
| --- | --- |
|  | include data from agent experience on both simulated and real world |
|  | environments, along with a variety of natural language and image |
|  | datasets. See Table 1 for details on our training datasets. |
| Motivation | To create a multi-modal, multi-task, multi-embodiment generalist pol |
|  | icy we collected as much, diverse, data as possible. Joint training on |
|  | all the datasets has produced a single network, Gato, which is capable |
|  | of playing Atari, captioning images, chat, stacking blocks with a real |
|  | robot arm, and more. See Section 3 for a more detailed discussion of |
|  | our training datasets. |
| Preprocessing | The multi-modal training data is tokenized into a stream of discrete |
|  | embeddings. Section 2.1 and Section 2.2 go into details of how different |
|  | modalities are tokenized and combined. |
|  | Quantitative Analyses |
| Unitary Results | We present several evaluations of Gato against different benchmarks. |
|  | See Figure 5 for an analysis of Gato's performance on in distribution |
|  | control tasks. Sections 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4 analyze performance on out of |
|  | distribution control tasks. Finally, see Section 5.1 for a discussion on |
|  | how model scale affects in-distribution performance. |
|  | Ethical Considerations |
| Data | The vision and language datasets used include racist, sexist, and oth |
|  | erwise harmful context. |

| Risks and Harms | In addition to the potential harms of toxic image and language training data, Gato's real world embodiment introduces physical safety harms |
| --- | --- |
|  | due to misuse or malfunctioning. |
| Mitigations | No mitigation of bias introduced by vision and language data beyond |
|  | the filtering of sexually explicit content, as in Alayrac et al. (2022). |
|  | Physical risk is mitigated through safety measures implemented by |
|  | robotics environment designers. |
|  | Caveats and Recommendation |
| Future work | The interaction of diverse training data domains and the different affor |

dances faced in evaluation is poorly understood, and potential ethical and safety risks arise as the generalist's capabilities grow.

## **B Agent Data Tokenization Details**

In this section we provide additional details on our tokenization schemes. Our agent data is sequenced as follows:

- **Episodes** are presented to the agent in order of time (timesteps).
- **Timesteps** in turn are presented in the following order:
	- **Observations** ([y1:k, x1:m, z1:n]) are ordered lexicographically by key, each item is sequenced as follows:
		- ∗ Text tokens (y1:k) are in the same order as the raw input text.
		- ∗ Image patch tokens (x1:m) are in raster order.
		- ∗ Tensors (z1:n) (such as discrete and continuous observations) are in row-major order.
	- **Separator** ( 0 | 0 ); a designated separator token is provided after observations.
	- **Actions** (a1:A) are tokenized as discrete or continuous values and in row-major order.

A full sequence of tokens is thus given as the concatenation of data from T timesteps:

s1:L = [[y 1 1:k , x1 1:m, z1 1:n , 0 | 0 , a1 1:A]*, . . . ,* [y T 1:k , xT 1:m, zT 1:n , 0 | 0 , aT 1:A]],

where L = T(k + m + n + 1 + A) is the total number of tokens.

Each floating point element of tensors in the observation sequence is mu-law companded as in WaveNet (Oord et al., 2016):

$$F(x)=\mbox{sgn}(x)\frac{\log(|x|\mu+1.0)}{\log(M\mu+1.0)}\tag{3}$$

with parameters µ = 100 and M = 256. (If the floating-point tensor is in the action set, we do not need to compand the elements in the sequence because actions are only defined in the range [−1, 1] for all our environments.) All the elements are subsequently clipped so that they fall in the set [−1, 1]. Finally, they are discretized using bins of uniform width on the domain [−1, 1]. We use 1024 bins and shift the resulting integers so they are not overlapping with the ones used for text tokens. The tokenized result is therefore a sequence of integers within the range of [32000, 33024).

See Figure 14 and Figure 15 for visualizations of tokenizing and sequencing values (both discrete and continuous) and images. See Section C for details about local position encodings referenced in the figures.

#### Table 5: **Gato transformer hyperparameters.**

The transformer hyperparameters of Gato are presented in Table 5. We also list the hyperparameters of smaller architecture variants used in Section 5.

## **C.2 Embedding Function**

The ResNet block uses the v2 architecture (He et al., 2016b), contains GroupNorm (Wu & He, 2018) with 32 groups instead of LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016), and GELU (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) activation functions instead of RELU. The block is diagrammed in Figure 16.

#### **C.3 Position Encodings**

After tokens are mapped into token embeddings, two position encodings are added to the token embeddings (when applicable) to provide temporal and spatial information to the model. These are described below.

![](_page_33_Figure_1.jpeg)

Figure 17: **Patch position encodings.** Calculating patch position encodings (red) within the global image (far left). The relative row and column positions (i.e. positions normalized between [0, 1]) are first discretized using uniform binning and used to index a learnable row and column position encoding. These two encodings are then added to the token embedding corresponding to the patch.

#### **Patch Position Encodings**

These position encodings convey information about a patch's global position within the image from which the patch was extracted. First, the relative row and column intervals of the patch are calculated by normalizing the patch's pixel intervals by the image resolution. The row and column normalized intervals are then quantized into a vocabulary size (we use 128) and are used to index a row and column table of learnable position encodings. The method in which the quantized row and column intervals are converted into indices depends on whether we are training or evaluating the model: during training a random index is uniformly sampled from the quantized interval, while during evaluation we deterministically take the (rounded) mean of the interval. Once row and column position encoding are retrieved from the embedding table, they are added onto the token embedding produced by the resnet embedding function, as described previously.

To more concretely demonstrate this process, we provide an example in Figure 17. We will follow the process with the patch highlighted in red on the left of the subfigure. The image is of resolution 80 × 64 and each patch is 16 × 16, meaning there are 5 × 4 = 20 patches total. The highlighted patch starts at pixel row interval [16, 32] and pixel column interval [32, 64]. Normalized, the row interval is therefore [0.25, 0.5] and the column interval is [0.4, 0.6]. We then separately quantize the intervals into 128 uniformly spaced bins, with the resulting quantized row interval being [32, 64] and the quantized column interval being [51, 77]. During training, we uniformly sample integers between the quantized row intervals, whereas during testing we would use the means, which are index 48 for row position and index 64 for column position. The row and column positions are finally used to index separate row and column position encoding tables to produce learnable embeddings which are added onto the corresponding patch token embedding.

#### **Local Observation Position Encodings**

The local observation position encoding adds positional information about where observation tokens are positioned within the local time-step they were an element of. First, we reiterate that, during tokenization, for each time-step all elements of the observation set are tokenized into sequences and concatenated into an observation sequence. Each token in this observation sequence is given an index which corresponds to the sequence order, i.e. the first token is 0 and the last is the length of the observation sequence minus one. After embedding, for any tokens that were a part of an observation set, the corresponding observation token

Figure 18: **Local position encodings.** An example demonstrating how local position encodings are defined within each time-step's observation and action token subsequences. Note that no position encodings are added to action tokens.

index is used to index an embedding table of learnable position encodings, with one embedding for every possible observation token index (in practice we simply set the table size to a large value like 512). The position encoding is then added onto the observation token embedding to produce the final token embedding. Note that all action tokens are given the same position encoding regardless of their position in the time-step sequence. We illustrate an example of this process in Figure 18.

# **D Pretraining Setup**

**Optimizer:** For all models we use the AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017) optimizer with a linear warmup and cosine schedule decay. The linear warmup lasts for 15, 000 steps, starting from a learning rate of 1e-7 and ending at a different maximum learning rate depending on the model (see Table 6). This learning rate is then cosine decayed by a factor 10x over 1,000,000 steps. The AdamW optimizer has parameters β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95 and = 1e-8. We use a batch size of 512 and a sequence length of 1024 tokens for all models.

**Regularization:** We train with an AdamW weight decay parameter of 0.1. Additionally, we use stochastic depth (Huang et al., 2016) during pretraining, where each of the transformer sub-layers (i.e. each Multi-Head Attention and Dense Feedforward layer) is skipped with a probability of 0.1.

| Hyperparameter | Gato 1.18B | 364M | 79M |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Maximum Learning Rate | 1e-4 | 2e-4 | 1e-4 |
| Minimum Learning Rate | 1e-5 | 2e-5 | 1e-5 |

| Table 6: Learning rate schedule hyperparameters for the different model scales. |
| --- |

## **E Fine-tuning Setup**

**Optimizer:** For all models we use the Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) optimizer with a constant learning rate of 1e-5. The Adam optimizer has parameters β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95 and = 1e-8. We use a batch size of 64 and a sequence length of 1024 tokens for all models. We train for 10,000 gradient steps.

**Regularization:** We use dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) with a rate of 0.1.

**Evaluation:** We evaluate agent every 100 learning steps. Each evaluation reports the average of 10 runs of a given checkpoint. The moving average of 5 such scores is computed (to gather 50 runs together). The final fine-tuning performance is defined as the maximum of these smoothed scores.

**Datasets:** We generated data for the fine-tuning tasks the same way we did for the other tasks (see Section 3.1 for details). Instead of using all the data for a fine-tuning task, we discarded all but 2000 best episodes (leading to the highest returns). The fine-tuning datasets were created in the following way. We randomly took 1000 episodes (out of 2000 preselected episodes), then a subset of 100 episodes from the selected episodes, then 10, 5, 3, and finally a single episode. We repeated this procedure 3 times to obtain 3 series of cascading subsets for each task. Each subset is used to conduct one fine-tuning experiment, and each is reported on our plots in Section 5.2 as a separate point.

**Task settings:** We have not altered any of the tasks and used their canonical versions. As 3 out of 4 tasks are open sourced, they do not need further explanation. For the fourth task, DMLab order_of_apples_forage_simple, the goal is to collect apples in the right order, green ones first followed by the gold one.

# **F Data Collection Details**

## **F.1 Atari**

We collect two separate sets of Atari environments. The first (that we refer to as ALE Atari) consists of 51 canonical games from the Arcade Learning Environment (Bellemare et al., 2013). The second (that we refer to as ALE Atari Extended) is a set of alternative games3 with their game mode and difficulty randomly set at the beginning of each episode.

For each environment in these sets we collect data by training a Muesli (Hessel et al., 2021) agent for 200M total environment steps. We record approximately 20,000 random episodes generated by the agent during training.

## **F.2 Sokoban**

Sokoban is a planning problem (Racanière et al., 2017), in which the agent has to push boxes to target locations. Some of the moves are irreversible and consequently mistakes can render the puzzle unsolvable. Planning ahead of time is therefore necessary to succeed at this puzzle. We use a Muesli (Hessel et al., 2021) agent to collect training data.

### **F.3 BabyAI**

BabyAI is a gridworld environment whose levels consist of instruction-following tasks that are described by a synthetic language. We generate data for these levels with the built-in BabyAI bot. The bot has access to extra information which is used to execute optimal solutions, see Section C in the appendix of (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018) for more details about the bot. We collect 100,000 episodes for each level.

## **F.4 DeepMind Control Suite**

The DeepMind Control Suite (Tunyasuvunakool et al., 2020; Tassa et al., 2018) is a set of physics-based simulation environments. For each task in the control suite we collect two disjoint sets of data, one using only state features and another using only pixels. We use a D4PG (Barth-Maron et al., 2018) agent to collect data from tasks with state features, and an MPO (Abdolmaleki et al., 2018) based agent to collect data using pixels.

We also collect data for randomized versions of the control suite tasks with a D4PG agent. These versions randomize the actuator gear, joint range, stiffness, and damping, and geom size and density. There are two difficulty settings for the randomized versions. The small setting scales values by a random number sampled from the union of intervals [0.9, 0.95] ∪ [1.05, 1.1]. The large setting scales values by a random number sampled from the union of intervals [0.6, 0.8] ∪ [1.2, 1.4].

#### **F.5 DeepMind Lab**

DeepMind Lab (Beattie et al., 2016) is a first-person 3D environment designed to teach agents 3D vision from raw pixel inputs with an egocentric viewpoint, navigation, and planning.

We trained an IMPALA (Espeholt et al., 2018) agent jointly on a set of 18 parent DM Lab levels that generate maps procedurally for each new episode. Data was collected by executing the agent on these 18 levels, as well as an additional set of 237 levels handcrafted to test a diverse set of skills.

The 18 parent levels are characterized by high diversity of generated maps. The difference between the levels is rooted in hyper-parameters used in a generation process. These hyper-parameters control high-level characteristics such as types of structures spawned, difficulty of language instructions, or presence of specific tools. The parent levels were developed to improve performance of RL agents trained online on them.

In contrast to the parent levels, each of the additional handcrafted 237 levels uses almost the same map, and the main differences between instances of the same level map are aesthetics such as colors of walls or lighting conditions. The maps are not procedurally generated and were designed to test a diverse set of skills such as walking up stairs or using specific tools. They are similar to levels presented in Figure 3, Figure 7 and Figure 8 in aforementioned paper by Beattie et al. (2016).

Additional information on the 18 parent levels (and their relation to the other levels) is presnted in details in the NeurIPS Workshop talk *A Methodology for RL Environment Research* by Daniel Tanis4 .

In total, we collected data for 255 levels from the DeepMind Lab (18 parent levels and 237 handcrafted levels), 254 of which were used while training Gato. The remaining level was used for out of distribution evaluation.

### **F.6 Procgen Benchmark**

Procgen (Cobbe et al., 2020) is a suite of 16 procedurally generated Atari-like environments, which was proposed to benchmark sample efficiency and generalization in reinforcement learning. Data collection was done while training a R2D2 (Kapturowski et al., 2018) agent on each of the environments. We used the hard difficulty setting for all environments except for maze and heist, which we set to easy.

#### **F.7 Modular RL**

Modular RL (Huang et al., 2020) is a collection of MuJoCo (Todorov et al., 2012) based continuous control environments, composed of three sets of variants of the OpenAI Gym (Brockman et al., 2016) Walker2d-v2, Humanoid-v2, and Hopper-v2. Each variant is a morphological modification of the original body: the set of

<sup>4</sup>Available at https://neurips.cc/virtual/2021/workshop/21865#wse-detail-22801.

morphologies is generated by enumerating all possible subsets of limbs, and keeping only those sets that a) contain the torso, and b) still form a connected graph. This results in a set of variants with different input and output sizes, as well as different dynamics than the original morphologies. We collected data by training a single morphology-specific D4PG agent on each variant for a total of 140M actor steps, this was done for 30 random seeds per variant.

## **F.8 DeepMind Manipulation Playground**

The DeepMind Manipulation Playground (Zolna et al., 2021) is a suite of MuJoCo based simulated robot tasks. We collect data for 4 of the Jaco tasks (box, stack banana, insertion, and slide) using a Critic-Regularized Regression (CRR) agent (Wang et al., 2020) trained from images on human demonstrations. The collected data includes the MuJoCo physics state, which is we use for training and evaluating Gato.

#### **F.9 Meta-World**

Meta-World (Yu et al., 2020) is a suite of environments5 for benchmarking meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning. We collect data from all train and test tasks in the MT50 mode by training a MPO agent (Abdolmaleki et al., 2018) with unlimited environment seeds and with access to state of the MuJoCo physics engine. The collected data also contains the MuJoCo physics engine state.

## **G Real robotics evaluation details**

In the real world, control is asynchronous; physics does not wait for computations to finish. Thus, inference latency is a concern for evaluating a large model for real world tasks. In robotics, a fast control rate is thought to be critical for reacting to dynamic phenomena. The robot setup for RGB stacking has a 20Hz control rate (0.05 second timestep) by design. In order to reach an acceptable margin of latency, we modified inference at evaluation time by shortening the context length to 1. We also implemented a parallel sampling scheme where all the action tokens are zeroed out in the input sequences during training so we can sample all tokens corresponding to a robot action in a single model inference step instead of autoregressively as it's done in other domains. We found that the 1.18B parameter model was able to run on the hardware accelerators in our robots (NVidia GeForce RTX 3090s), but still overran the 20Hz control rate by a small amount (~0.01 seconds).

We use the sparse reward function described in Lee et al. (2021) for data filtering. We only select trajectories with *final* task success; that is, a sparse reward of 1 on the final timestep.

## **H Skill Mastery architecture**

The numbers reported for the Skill Mastery benchmark were collected by executing a model zero-shot that used an earlier version of the Gato architecture. Instead of the ResNet patch embedding, a similar architecture using a local transformer was used to embed image patch tokens. The local position embeddings and patch position embeddings were not used. These changes were implemented and found to improve Gato's performance after the pretraining data was changed (as we decided to focus on Skill Generalization instead of Skill Mastery challenge), which is why they are presented as the final architecture of our full model.

<sup>5</sup>We used a version from July 23rd 2021, specifically the following version: https://github.com/rlworkgroup/metaworld/ commit/a0009ed9a208ff9864a5c1368c04c273bb20dd06.

Figure 19: **Few-shot performance of Gato for Skill Generalization in simulation.** Each test set object is plotted separately. We ablate over different pretraining datasets.

## **I Additional robotics ablations**

We conducted a series of ablations in simulation to better understand the effect of diverse pretraining data in the robotics domain (see Figure 19). We included the same baselines as in Section 5.2, selecting the 364M parameter size variant, as well as an additional baseline trained with control suite data only. The DM Control-only agent is superior to the base Gato at zero-shot transfer and with a lot of fine-tuning data, suggesting that Gato may not be using the representations learned from the text-based datasets when adapting to robotics tasks. The same domain only agent performs the best overall, matching the CRR baseline at 1 fine-tuning episode and outperforming it with more data, suggesting that Gato at current scale can trade its generalization capacity for data-efficient and effective few-shot adaptation.

## **J Attention visualization**

To render the transformer attention weights, we retrieved the cross-attention logits, a tensor with dimension (*H, T, T*) where H is the number of heads and T is the number of tokens in a sequence. The (*h, i, j*)th entry of this matrix can be interpreted as the amount that head h attends to token j from token i. Due to Gato's image tokenization scheme, there are multiple tokens per timestep. Therefore to render the attention for a particular timestep, we took the sub-matrix that corresponds to that timestep. We then applied a softmax over the rows of this matrix to normalize the relevant values. Because we are only interested in attention to the previous tokens, we excluded the diagonal by setting it to negative infinity before softmax.

To measure the importance of each patch, we averaged the attention weights over the corresponding column. Because Gato uses a causal transformer, the attention matrix is lower triangular, so the mean was only considered over the sub-column below the diagonal of the matrix. This corresponds to the average attention paid to particular patch over a whole timestep.

Using this method, we found the attention maps at the first layer the transformer to be most interpretable, agreeing with the findings of Abnar & Zuidema (2020). Certain heads clearly track task-specific entities and regions of the image. Figure 20 shows the attention maps for manually selected heads at the first layer for several tasks.

## **Abstract**

We propose Dual PatchNorm: two Layer Normalization layers (LayerNorms), before and after the patch embedding layer in Vision Transformers. We demonstrate that Dual Patch-Norm outperforms the result of exhaustive search for alternative LayerNorm placement strategies in the Transformer block itself. In our experiments on image classification, contrastive learning, semantic segmentation and transfer on downstream classification datasets, incorporating this trivial modification, often leads to improved accuracy over well-tuned vanilla Vision Transformers and never hurts.

## **1 Introduction**

Layer Normalization (Ba et al., 2016) is key to Transformer's success in achieving both stable training and high performance across a range of tasks. Such normalization is also crucial in Vision Transformers (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2021) which closely follow the standard recipe of the original Transformer model.

Following the "pre-LN" strategy in Baevski & Auli (2019) and Xiong et al. (2020), ViTs place LayerNorms before the self-attention layer and MLP layer in each Transformer block. We explore the following question: Can we improve ViT models with a different LayerNorm ordering? First, across five ViT architectures on ImageNet-1k (Russakovsky et al., 2015), we demonstrate that an exhaustive search of LayerNorm placements between the components of a Transformer block does not improve classification accuracy. This indicates that the pre-LN strategy in ViT is close to optimal. Our observation also applies to other alternate LayerNorm placements: NormFormer (Shleifer et al., 2021) and Sub-LN (Wang et al., 2022), which in isolation, do not improve over strong ViT classification models.

Second, we make an intriguing observation: placing additional LayerNorms before and after the standard ViT-projection layer, which we call Dual PatchNorm (DPN), can improve significantly over well tuned vanilla ViT baselines. Our experiments on image classification across three different datasets with varying number of examples and contrastive learning, demonstrate the efficacy of DPN. Interestingly, our qualitative experiments show that the LayerNorm scale parameters upweight the pixels at the center and corners of each patch.

Dual PatchNorm consists of a 2 line change to the standard ViT-projection layer.

## **2 Related Work**

Kim et al. (2021) add a LayerNorm after the patch-embedding and show that this improves the robustness of ViT against corruptions on small-scale datasets. Xiao et al. (2021) replace the standard Transformer stem with a small number of stacked stride-two 3 × 3 convolutions with batch normalizations and show that this improves the sensitivity to optimization hyperparameters and final accuracy. Xu et al. (2019) analyze LayerNorm and show that the derivatives of mean and variance have a greater contribution to final performance as opposed to forward normalization. Beyer et al. (2022a) consider Image-LN and Patch-LN as alternative strategies to efficiently train a single model for different patch sizes. Wang et al. (2022) add extra LayerNorms before the final dense projection in the self-attention block and the non-linearity in the MLP block, with a different initialization strategy. Shleifer et al. (2021) propose extra LayerNorms after the final dense projection in the self-attention block instead with a LayerNorm after the non-linearity in the MLP block. Unlike previous work, we show that LayerNorms before and after the embedding layer provide consistent improvements on classification and contrastive learning tasks. An orthogonal line of work (Liu et al., 2021; d'Ascoli et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021) involves incorporating convolutional inductive biases to VisionTransformers. Here, we exclusively and extensively study LayerNorm placements of vanilla ViT.

## **3 Background**

#### **3.1 Patch Embedding Layer in Vision Transformer**

Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) consist of a patch embedding layer (PE) followed by a stack of Transformer blocks. The PE layer first rearranges the image x ∈ RH×W×3 into a sequence of patches xp ∈ R HW P 2 ×P 2 where P denotes the patch size. It then projects each patch independently with a dense projection to constitute a sequence of "visual tokens" xt ∈ R HW P 2 ×D P controls the trade-off between granularity of the visual tokens and the computational cost in the subsequent Transformer layers.

#### **3.2 Layer Normalization**

Given a sequence of N patches x ∈ RN×D, LayerNorm as applied in ViTs consist of two operations:

$${\bf x}=\frac{{\bf x}-\mu(x)}{\sigma(x)}\tag{1}$$

$${\bf y}=\gamma{\bf x}+\beta\tag{2}$$

where µ(x) ∈ RN , σ(x) ∈ RN , γ ∈ RD, β ∈ RD.

First, Eq. 1 normalizes each patch xi ∈ RD of the sequence to have zero mean and unit standard deviation. Then, Eq 2 applies learnable shifts and scales β and γ which are shared across all patches.

## **4 Methods**

### **4.1 Alternate LayerNorm placements:**

Following Baevski & Auli (2019) and Xiong et al. (2020), ViTs incorporate LayerNorm before every selfattention and MLP layer, commonly known as the pre-LN strategy. For each of the self-attention and MLP layer, we evaluate 3 strategies: place LayerNorm before (pre-LN), after (post-LN), before and after (pre+post-LN) leading to nine different combinations.

#### **4.2 Dual PatchNorm**

Instead of adding LayerNorms to the Transformer block, we also propose to apply LayerNorms in the stem alone, both before and after the patch embedding layer. In particular, we replace

$${\bf x}={\rm PE}({\bf x})\tag{3}$$

with

$\bf x=LN(PE(LN(x)))$

and keep the rest of the architecture fixed. We call this Dual PatchNorm (DPN).

## **5 Experiments on ImageNet Classification**

#### **5.1 Setup**

We adopt the standard formulation of Vision Transformers (Sec. 3.1) which has shown broad applicability across a number of vision tasks. We train ViT architectures (with and without DPN) in a supervised fashion on 3 different datasets with varying number of examples: ImageNet-1k (1M), ImageNet-21k (21M) and JFT (4B) (Zhai et al., 2022a). In our experiments, we apply DPN directly on top of the baseline ViT recipes without additional hyperparamter tuning. We split the ImageNet train set into a train and validation split, and use the validation split to arrive at the final DPN recipe.

**ImageNet 1k:** We train 5 architectures: Ti/16, S/16, S/32, B/16 and B/32 using the AugReg (Steiner et al., 2022) recipe for 93000 steps with a batch size of 4096 and report the accuracy on the official ImageNet validation split as is standard practice. The AugReg recipe provides the optimal mixup regularization (Zhang et al., 2017) and RandAugment (Cubuk et al., 2020) for each ViT backbone. Further, we evaluate a S/16 baseline (S/16+) with additional extensive hyperparameter tuning on ImageNet (Beyer et al., 2022b).Finally, we also apply DPN on top of the base and small DeiT variants (Touvron et al., 2021). Our full set of hyperparameters are available in Appendix C and Appendix D.

**ImageNet 21k:** We adopt a similar setup as in ImageNet 1k. We report ImageNet 25 shot accuracies in two training regimes: 93K and 930K steps.

**JFT:** We evaluate the ImageNet 25 shot accuracies of 3 variants (B/32, B/16 and L/16) on 2 training regimes: (220K and 1.1M steps) with a batch size of 4096. In this setup, we do not use any additional data augmentation or mixup regularization.

On ImageNet-1k, we report the 95% confidence interval across atleast 3 independent runs. On ImageNet-21k and JFT, because of expensive training runs, we train each model once and report the mean 25 shot accuracy with 95% confidence interval across 3 random seeds.

#### **5.2 DPN versus alternate LayerNorm placements**

Each Transformer block in ViT consists of a self-attention (SA) and MLP layer. Following the pre-LN strategy (Xiong et al., 2020), LN is inserted before both the SA and MLP layers. We first show that the default pre-LN strategy in ViT models is close to optimal by evaluating alternate LN placements on ImageNet-1k. We then contrast this with the performance of NormFormer, Sub-LN and DPN.

For each SA and MLP layer, we evaluate three LN placements: Pre, Post and Pre+Post, that leads to nine total LN placement configurations. Additionally, we evaluate the LayerNorm placements in NormFormer (Shleifer et al., 2021) and Sub LayerNorm (Wang et al., 2022) which add additional LayerNorms within each of the self-attention and MLP layers in the transformer block. Figure 1 shows that none of the placements outperform the default Pre-LN strategy significantly, indicating that the default pre-LN strategy is close to optimal. NormFormer provides some improvements on ViT models with a patch size of 32. DPN on the other-hand provides consistent improvements across all 5 architectures.

Figure 1: The plot displays the accuracy gains of different LayerNorm placement strategies over the default pre-LN strategy. Each blue point (**Other LN placement**) corresponds to a different LN placement in the Transformer block. None of the placements outperform the default Pre-LN strategy on ImageNet-1k (Russakovsky et al., 2015). Applying DPN (black cross) provides consistent improvements across all 5 architectures.

The table shows their ImageNet 25 shot accuracies with and without Dual PatchNorm

#### **5.3 Comparison to ViT**

In Table 1 left, DPN improved the accuracy of B/16, the best ViT model by 0.7 while S/32 obtains the maximum accuracy gain of 1.9. The average gain across all architecture is 1.4. On top of DeiT-S and DeiT-B, DPN provides an improvement of 0.3 and 0.2 respectively. Further, we finetune B/16 and B/32 models with and without DPN on high resolution ImageNet (384 × 384) for 5000 steps with a batch-size of 512 (See Appendix D for the full hyperparameter setting). Applying DPN improves high-res, finetuned B/16 and B/32 by 0.6 and 1.0 respectively.

DPN improves all architectures trained on ImageNet-21k (Table 1 Right) and JFT (Table 2) on shorter training regimes with average gains of 1.7 and 0.8 respectively. On longer training regimes, DPN improves the accuracy of the best-performing architectures on JFT and ImageNet-21k by 0.5 and 0.4 respectively.

In three cases, Ti/16 and S/32 with ImageNet-21k and B/16 with JFT, DPN matches or leads to marginally worse results than the baseline. Nevertheless, across a large fraction of ViT models, simply employing DPN out-of-the-box on top of well-tuned ViT baselines lead to significant improvements.

#### **5.4 Finetuning on ImageNet with DPN**

We finetune four models trained on JFT-4B with two resolutions on ImageNet-1k: (B/32, B/16) × (220K, 1.1M) steps on resolutions 224 × 224 and 384 × 384. On B/32 we observe a consistent improvement across all configurations. With L/16, DPN outperforms the baseline on 3 out of 4 configurations.

| Arch | Base | DPN | Arch | Resolution | Steps | Base | DPN |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 220K steps |  | B/32 | 224 | 220K | 77.6 ± 0.06 | 78.3 | ± 0.00 |

## **6 Experiments on Downstream Tasks**

#### **6.1 Finetuning on VTAB**

We finetune ImageNet-pretrained B/16 and B/32 with and without DPN on the Visual Task Adaption benchmark (VTAB) (Zhai et al., 2019). VTAB consists of 19 datasets: 7 Natural , 4 Specialized and 8 Structured . Natural consist of datasets with natural images captured with standard cameras, Specialized has images captured with specialized equipment and Structured require scene comprehension. We use the VTAB training protocol which defines a standard train split of 800 examples and a validation split of 200 examples per dataset. We perform a lightweight sweep across 3 learning rates on each dataset and use the mean validation accuracy across 3 seeds to pick the best model. Appendix E references the standard VTAB finetuning configuration. We then report the corresponding mean test score across 3 seeds in Table 3. In Table 3, accuracies within 95% confidence interval are not bolded.

On Natural , which has datasets closest to the source dataset ImageNet, B/32 and B/16 with DPN significantly outperform the baseline on 7 out of 7 and 6 out of 7 datasets respectively. Sun397 (Xiao et al., 2010) is the only dataset where applying DPN performs worse. In Appendix F, we additionally show that DPN helps when B/16 is trained from scratch on Sun397. Applying DPN on Structured improves accuracy on 4 out of 8 datasets and remains neutral on 2 on both B/16 and B/32. On Specialized , DPN improves on 1 out of 4 datasets, and is neutral on 2. To conclude, DPN offers the biggest improvements, when finetuned on Natural . On Structured and Specialized , DPN is a lightweight alternative, that can help or at least not hurt on a majority of datasets.

Table 3: We evaluate DPN on VTAB (Zhai et al., 2019). When finetuned on Natural , B/32 and B/16 with DPN significantly outperform the baseline on 7 out of 7 and 6 out of 7 datasets respectively. On Structured , DPN improves both B/16 and B/32 on 4 out of 8 datasets and remains neutral on 2. On Specialized , DPN improves on 1 out of 4 datasets, and is neutral on 2.

#### **6.2 Contrastive Learning**

We apply DPN on image-text contrastive learning (Radford et al., 2021). Each minibatch consists of a set of image and text pairs. We train a text and image encoder to map an image to its correct text over all other texts in a minibatch. Specifically, we adopt LiT (Zhai et al., 2022b), where we initialize and freeze the image encoder from a pretrained checkpoint and train the text encoder from scratch. To evaluate zero-shot ImageNet accuracy, we represent each ImageNet class by its text label, which the text encoder maps into a class embedding. For a given image embedding, the prediction is the class corresponding to the nearest class embedding.

We evalute 4 frozen image encoders: 2 architectures (B/32 and L/16) trained with 2 schedules (220K and 1.1M steps). We resue standard hyperparameters and train only the text encoder using a contrastive loss for 55000 steps with a batch-size of 16384. Table 4 shows that on B/32, DPN improves over the baselines on both the setups while on L/16 DPN provides improvement when the image encoder is trained with shorter training schedules.

#### **6.3 Semantic Segmentation**

We finetune ImageNet-pretrained B/16 with and without DPN on the ADE-20K 512×512 (Zhou et al., 2019) semantic segmentation task. Following Strudel et al. (2021), a single dense layer maps the ViT features into per-patch output logits. A bilinear upsampling layer then transforms the output distribution into the final high resolution 512×512 semantic segmentation output. We finetune the entire ViT backbone with standard

| Arch | Steps | Base |  | DPN |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B/32 | 220K | 61.9 | ± 0.12 | 63.0 | ± 0.09 |
| B/32 | 1.1M | 67.4 | ± 0.07 | 68.0 | ± 0.09 |
| L/16 | 220K | 75.0 | ± 0.11 | 75.4 | ± 0.00 |
| L/16 | 1.1M | 78.7 | ± 0.05 | 78.7 | ± 0.1 |

Table 4: Zero Shot ImageNet accuracy on the LiT (Zhai et al., 2022b) contrastive learning setup.

| Fraction of Train Data | 1/16 |  | 1/8 | 1/4 | 1/2 | 1 |

| B/16 | 27.3 ± 0.09 | 32.6 | ± 0.09 | 36.9 ± 0.13 | 40.8 ± 0.1 | 45.6 ± 0.08 |

per-pixel cross-entropy loss. Appendix G specifies the full set of finetuning hyperparameters. Table 5 reports the mean mIOU across 10 random seeds and on different fractions of training data. The improvement in IoU is consistent across all setups.

## **7 Ablations**

**Is normalizing both the inputs and outputs of the embedding layer optimal?** In Eq 4, DPN applies LN to both the inputs and outputs to the embedding layer. We assess three alternate strategies: Pre, **Post** and **Post PosEmb** (Radford et al., 2021). Pre applies LayerNorm only to the inputs, **Post** only to the outputs and **Post PosEmb** to the outputs after being summed with positional embeddings.

Table 6 displays the accuracy gains with two alternate strategies: Pre is unstable on B/32 leading to a significant drop in accuracy. Additionally, Pre obtains minor drops in accuracy on S/32 and Ti/16. **Post** and **Post PosEmb** achieve worse performance on smaller models B/32, S/32 and Ti/16. Our experiments show that applying LayerNorm to both inputs and outputs of the embedding layer is necessary to obtain consistent improvements in accuracy across all ViT variants.

|  | B/16 | S/16 | B/32 | S/32 | Ti/16 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pre | -0.1 | 0.0 | -2.6 | -0.2 | -0.3 |
| Post | 0.0 | -0.2 | -0.5 | -0.7 | -1.1 |
| Post PosEmb | 0.0 | -0.1 | -0.4 | -0.9 | -1.1 |
| Only learnable | -0.8 | -0.9 | -1.2 | -1.6 | -1.6 |
| RMSNorm | 0.0 | -0.1 | -0.4 | -0.5 | -1.7 |
| No learnable | -0.5 | 0.0 | -0.2 | -0.1 | -0.1 |

Table 6: Ablations of various components of DPN. **Pre:** LayerNorm only to the inputs of the embedding layer. **Post:** LayerNorm only to the outputs of the embedding layer. **No learnable:** Per-patch normalization without learnable LayerNorm parameters. **Only learnable:** Learnable scales and shifts without standardization.

**Normalization vs Learnable Parameters:** As seen in Sec. 3.2, LayerNorm constitutes a normalization operation followed by learnable scales and shifts. We also ablate the effect of each of these operations in DPN.

Applying only learnable scales and shifts without normalization leads to a significant decrease in accuracy across all architectures. (See: **Only learnable** in Table 6). Additionally, removing the learnable parameters leads to unstable training on B/16 (**No learnable** in Table 6). Finally, removing the centering and bias parameters as done in **RMSNorm** (Zhang & Sennrich, 2019), reduces the accuracy of B/32, S/32 and Ti/16. We conclude that while both normalization and learnable parameters contribute to the success of DPN, normalization has a higher impact.

## **8 Analysis**

#### **8.1 Gradient Norm Scale**

![](_page_7_Figure_4.jpeg)

Figure 2: Gradient Norms with and without DPN in B/16. **Left:** Gradient Norm vs Depth. **Right:** Gradient Norm of the embedding layer vs number of steps.

We report per-layer gradient norms with and without DPN on B/16. Fig. 2 (Left) plots the mean gradient norm of the last 1000 training steps as a function of depth with and without DPN. Interestingly, the gradient norm of the base ViT patch embedding (black) is disproportionately large compared to the other layers. Applying DPN (red), on the other hand, scales down the gradient norm of the embedding layer. Fig. 2 (Right) additionally shows that the gradient norm of the embedding layer is reduced not only before convergence but also throughout the course of training. This property is consistent across ViT architectures of different sizes (Appendix H).

#### **8.2 Visualizing Scale Parameters**

Note that the first LayerNorm in Eq. 4 is applied directly on patches, that is, to raw pixels. Thus, the learnable parameters (biases and scales) of the first LayerNorm can be visualized directly in pixel space. Fig. 3 shows the scales of our smallest model and largest model which are: Ti/16 trained on ImageNet for 90000 steps and L/16 trained on JFT for 1.1M steps respectively. Since the absolute magnitude of the scale parameters vary across the R, G and B channel, we visualize the scale separately for each channel. Interestingly, for both models the scale parameter increases the weight of the pixels in the center of the patch and at the corners.

## **9 Conclusion**

We propose a simple modification to vanilla ViT models and show its efficacy on classification, contrastive learning, semantic segmentation and transfer to small classification datasets.

## **A Initial Project Idea**

We arrived at the Dual PatchNorm solution because of another project that explored adding whitened (decorrelated) patches to ViT. Our initial prototype had a LayerNorm right after the decorrelated patches, to ensure that they are of an appropriate scale. This lead to improvements across multiple benchmarks, suggesting that whitened patches can improve image classification. We later found out via ablations, that just LayerNorm is sufficient at the inputs and adding whitened patches on their own could degrade performance. Our paper highlights the need for rigorous ablations of complicated algorithms to arrive at simpler solutions which can be equally or even more effective.

## **B Code**

We perform all our experiments in the big-vision (Beyer et al., 2022c) and Scenic (Dehghani et al., 2022) library. Since the first LayerNorm of DPN is directly applied on pixels, we replace the first convolution with a patchify operation implemented with the einops (Rogozhnikov, 2022) library and a dense projection.

## **F SUN397: Train from scratch**

On Sun397, applying DPN improves ViT models trained from scratch. We first search for an optimal hyperparameter setting across 3 learning rates: 1e-3, 3e-4, 1e-4, 2 weight decays: 0.03, 0.1 and two dropout values: 0.0, 0.1. We then searched across 3 mixup values 0.0, 0.2 and 0.5 and 4 randaugment distortion magnitudes 0, 5, 10 and 15. We train the final config for 600 epochs.

|  | Base | DPN |  | Base | DPN |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 41.4 | 47.5 |  | 45.6 | 51.8 |
| + Augmentation | 48.3 | 50.7 | + Augmentation | 58.7 | 63.0 |
| + Train Longer | 52.5 | 56.0 | + Train Longer | 60.8 | 66.3 |

# The Llama 3 Herd of Models

Llama Team, AI @ Meta1

1A detailed contributor list can be found in the appendix of this paper.

Modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems are powered by foundation models. This paper presents a new set of foundation models, called Llama 3. It is a herd of language models that natively support multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is a dense Transformer with 405B parameters and a context window of up to 128K tokens. This paper presents an extensive empirical evaluation of Llama 3. We find that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language models such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. We publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and post-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and our Llama Guard 3 model for input and output safety. The paper also presents the results of experiments in which we integrate image, video, and speech capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach. We observe this approach performs competitively with the state-of-the-art on image, video, and speech recognition tasks. The resulting models are not yet being broadly released as they are still under development.

### 1 Introduction

Foundation models are general models of language, vision, speech, and/or other modalities that are designed to support a large variety of AI tasks. They form the basis of many modern AI systems.

The development of modern foundation models consists of two main stages: (1) a pre-training stage in which the model is trained at massive scale using straightforward tasks such as next-word prediction or captioning and (2) a post-training stage in which the model is tuned to follow instructions, align with human preferences, and improve specific capabilities (for example, coding and reasoning).

In this paper, we present a new set of foundation models for language, called Llama 3. The Llama 3 Herd of models natively supports multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is dense Transformer with 405B parameters, processing information in a context window of up to 128K tokens. Each member of the herd is listed in Table 1. All the results presented in this paper are for the Llama 3.1 models, which we will refer to as Llama 3 throughout for brevity.

We believe there are three key levers in the development of high-quality foundation models: data, scale, and managing complexity. We seek to optimize for these three levers in our development process:

- Data. Compared to prior versions of Llama (Touvron et al., 2023a,b), we improved both the quantity and quality of the data we use for pre-training and post-training. These improvements include the development of more careful pre-processing and curation pipelines for pre-training data and the development of more rigorous quality assurance and filtering approaches for post-training data. We pre-train Llama 3 on a corpus of about 15T multilingual tokens, compared to 1.8T tokens for Llama 2.
- Scale. We train a model at far larger scale than previous Llama models: our flagship language model was pre-trained using 3.8 × 1025 FLOPs, almost 50× more than the largest version of Llama 2. Specifically, we pre-trained a flagship model with 405B trainable parameters on 15.6T text tokens. As expected per

scaling laws for foundation models, our flagship model outperforms smaller models trained using the same procedure. While our scaling laws suggest our flagship model is an approximately compute-optimal size for our training budget, we also train our smaller models for much longer than is compute-optimal. The resulting models perform better than compute-optimal models at the same inference budget. We use the flagship model to further improve the quality of those smaller models during post-training.

- Managing complexity. We make design choices that seek to maximize our ability to scale the model development process. For example, we opt for a standard dense Transformer model architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) with minor adaptations, rather than for a mixture-of-experts model (Shazeer et al., 2017) to maximize training stability. Similarly, we adopt a relatively simple post-training procedure based on supervised finetuning (SFT), rejection sampling (RS), and direct preference optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al. (2023)) as opposed to more complex reinforcement learning algorithms (Ouyang et al., 2022; Schulman et al., 2017) that tend to be less stable and harder to scale.
The result of our work is Llama 3: a herd of three multilingual1 language models with 8B, 70B, and 405B parameters. We evaluate the performance of Llama 3 on a plethora of benchmark datasets that span a wide range of language understanding tasks. In addition, we perform extensive human evaluations that compare Llama 3 with competing models. An overview of the performance of the flagship Llama 3 model on key benchmarks is presented in Table 2. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our flagship model performs on par with leading language models such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023a) across a variety of tasks, and is close to matching the state-of-the-art. Our smaller models are best-in-class, outperforming alternative models with similar numbers of parameters (Bai et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). Llama 3 also delivers a much better balance between helpfulness and harmlessness than its predecessor (Touvron et al., 2023b). We present a detailed analysis of the safety of Llama 3 in Section 5.4.

We are publicly releasing all three Llama 3 models under an updated version of the Llama 3 Community License; see https://llama.meta.com. This includes pre-trained and post-trained versions of our 405B parameter language model and a new version of our Llama Guard model (Inan et al., 2023) for input and output safety. We hope that the open release of a flagship model will spur a wave of innovation in the research community, and accelerate a responsible path towards the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI).

As part of the Llama 3 development process we also develop multimodal extensions to the models, enabling image recognition, video recognition, and speech understanding capabilities. These models are still under active development and not yet ready for release. In addition to our language modeling results, the paper presents results of our initial experiments with those multimodal models.

### 2 General Overview

The model architecture of Llama 3 is illustrated in Figure 1. The development of our Llama 3 language models comprises two main stages:

- Language model pre-training. We start by converting a large, multilingual text corpus to discrete tokens and pre-training a large language model (LLM) on the resulting data to perform next-token prediction. In the language model pre-training stage, the model learns the structure of language and obtains large amounts of knowledge about the world from the text it is "reading". To do this effectively, pre-training is performed at massive scale: we pre-train a model with 405B parameters on 15.6T tokens using a context window of 8K tokens. This standard pre-training stage is followed by a continued pre-training stage that increases the supported context window to 128K tokens. See Section 3 for details.
- Language model post-training. The pre-trained language model has a rich understanding of language but it does not yet follow instructions or behave in the way we would expect an assistant to. We align the model with human feedback in several rounds, each of which involves supervised finetuning (SFT) on instruction tuning data and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2024). At this post-training2 stage, we also integrate new capabilities, such as tool-use, and observe strong improvements in other areas, such as coding and reasoning. See Section 4 for details. Finally, safety mitigations are also incorporated into the model at the post-training stage, the details of which are described in Section 5.4.

The resulting models have a rich set of capabilities. They can answer questions in at least eight languages, write high-quality code, solve complex reasoning problems, and use tools out-of-the-box or in a zero-shot way.

We also perform experiments in which we add image, video, and speech capabilities to Llama 3 using a compositional approach. The approach we study comprises the three additional stages illustrated in Figure 28:

- Multi-modal encoder pre-training. We train separate encoders for images and speech. We train our image encoder on large amounts of image-text pairs. This teaches the model the relation between visual content and the description of that content in natural language. Our speech encoder is trained using a
<sup>2</sup> In this paper, we use the term "post-training" to refer to any model training that happens outside of pre-training.

self-supervised approach that masks out parts of the speech inputs and tries to reconstruct the masked out parts via a discrete-token representation. As a result, the model learns the structure of speech signals. See Section 7 for details on the image encoder and Section 8 for details on the speech encoder.

- Vision adapter training. We train an adapter that integrates the pre-trained image encoder into the pre-trained language model. The adapter consists of a series of cross-attention layers that feed imageencoder representations into the language model. The adapter is trained on text-image pairs. This aligns the image representations with the language representations. During adapter training, we also update the parameters of the image encoder but we intentionally do not update the language-model parameters. We also train a video adapter on top of the image adapter on paired video-text data. This enables the model to aggregate information across frames. See Section 7 for details.
- Speech adapter training. Finally, we integrate the speech encoder into the model via an adapter that converts speech encodings into token representations that can be fed directly into the finetuned language model. The parameters of the adapter and encoder are jointly updated in a supervised finetuning stage to enable high-quality speech understanding. We do not change the language model during speech adapter training. We also integrate a text-to-speech system. See Section 8 for details.

Our multimodal experiments lead to models that can recognize the content of images and videos, and support interaction via a speech interface. These models are still under development and not yet ready for release.

### 3 Pre-Training

Language model pre-training involves: (1) the curation and filtering of a large-scale training corpus, (2) the development of a model architecture and corresponding scaling laws for determining model size, (3) the development of techniques for efficient pre-training at large scale, and (4) the development of a pre-training recipe. We present each of these components separately below.

#### 3.1 Pre-Training Data

We create our dataset for language model pre-training from a variety of data sources containing knowledge until the end of 2023. We apply several de-duplication methods and data cleaning mechanisms on each data source to obtain high-quality tokens. We remove domains that contain large amounts of personally identifiable information (PII), and domains with known adult content.

#### 3.1.1 Web Data Curation

Much of the data we utilize is obtained from the web and we describe our cleaning process below.

PII and safety filtering. Among other mitigations, we implement filters designed to remove data from websites are likely to contain unsafe content or high volumes of PII, domains that have been ranked as harmful according to a variety of Meta safety standards, and domains that are known to contain adult content.

Text extraction and cleaning. We process the raw HTML content for non-truncated web documents to extract high-quality diverse text. To do so, we build a custom parser that extracts the HTML content and optimizes for precision in boilerplate removal and content recall. We evaluate our parser's quality in human evaluations, comparing it with popular third-party HTML parsers that optimize for article-like content, and found it to perform favorably. We carefully process HTML pages with mathematics and code content to preserve the structure of that content. We maintain the image alt attribute text since mathematical content is often represented as pre-rendered images where the math is also provided in the alt attribute. We experimentally evaluate different cleaning configurations. We find markdown is harmful to the performance of a model that is primarily trained on web data compared to plain text, so we remove all markdown markers.

De-duplication. We apply several rounds of de-duplication at the URL, document, and line level:

- URL-level de-duplication. We perform URL-level de-duplication across the entire dataset. We keep the most recent version for pages corresponding to each URL.
- Document-level de-duplication. We perform global MinHash (Broder, 1997) de-duplication across the entire dataset to remove near duplicate documents.
- Line-level de-duplication. We perform aggressive line-level de-duplication similar to ccNet (Wenzek et al., 2019). We remove lines that appeared more than 6 times in each bucket of 30M documents. Although our manual qualitative analysis showed that the line-level de-duplication removes not only leftover boilerplate from various websites such as navigation menus, cookie warnings, but also frequent high-quality text, our empirical evaluations showed strong improvements.

Heuristic filtering. We develop heuristics to remove additional low-quality documents, outliers, and documents with excessive repetitions. Some examples of heuristics include:

- We use duplicated n-gram coverage ratio (Rae et al., 2021) to remove lines that consist of repeated content such as logging or error messages. Those lines could be very long and unique, hence cannot be filtered by line-dedup.
- We use "dirty word" counting (Raffel et al., 2020) to filter out adult websites that are not covered by domain block lists.
- We use a token-distribution Kullback-Leibler divergence to filter out documents containing excessive numbers of outlier tokens compared to the training corpus distribution.

Model-based quality filtering. Further, we experiment with applying various model-based quality classifiers to sub-select high-quality tokens. These include using fast classifiers such as fasttext (Joulin et al., 2017) trained to recognize if a given text would be referenced by Wikipedia (Touvron et al., 2023a), as well as more compute-intensive Roberta-based classifiers (Liu et al., 2019a) trained on Llama 2 predictions. To train a quality classifier based on Llama 2, we create a training set of cleaned web documents, describe the quality requirements, and instruct Llama 2's chat model to determine if the documents meets these requirements. We use DistilRoberta (Sanh et al., 2019) to generate quality scores for each document for efficiency reasons. We experimentally evaluate the efficacy of various quality filtering configurations.

Code and reasoning data. Similar to DeepSeek-AI et al. (2024), we build domain-specific pipelines that extract code and math-relevant web pages. Specifically, both the code and reasoning classifiers are DistilRoberta models trained on web data annotated by Llama 2. Unlike the general quality classifier mentioned above, we conduct prompt tuning to target web pages containing math deduction, reasoning in STEM areas and code interleaved with natural language. Since the token distribution of code and math is substantially different than that of natural language, these pipelines implement domain-specific HTML extraction, customized text features and heuristics for filtering.

Multilingual data. Similar to our processing pipelines for English described above, we implement filters to remove data from websites that are likely to contain PII or unsafe content. Our multilingual text processing pipeline has several unique features:

- We use a fasttext-based language identification model to categorize documents into 176 languages.
- We perform document-level and line-level de-duplication within data for each language.

- We apply language-specific heuristics and model-based filters to remove low-quality documents.
In addition, we perform quality ranking of multilingual documents using a multilingual Llama 2-based classifier to ensure that high-quality content is prioritized. We determine the amount of multilingual tokens used in pre-training experimentally, balancing model performance on English and multilingual benchmarks.

#### 3.1.2 Determining the Data Mix

To obtain a high-quality language model, it is essential to carefully determine the proportion of different data sources in the pre-training data mix. Our main tools in determining this data mix are knowledge classification and scaling law experiments.

Knowledge classification. We develop a classifier to categorize the types of information contained in our web data to more effectively determine a data mix. We use this classifier to downsample data categories that are over-represented on the web, for example, arts and entertainment.

Scaling laws for data mix. To determine the best data mix, we perform scaling law experiments in which we train several small models on a data mix and use that to predict the performance of a large model on that mix (see Section 3.2.1). We repeat this process multiple times for different data mixes to select a new data mix candidate. Subsequently, we train a larger model on this candidate data mix and evaluate the performance of that model on several key benchmarks.

Data mix summary. Our final data mix contains roughly 50% of tokens corresponding to general knowledge, 25% of mathematical and reasoning tokens, 17% code tokens, and 8% multilingual tokens.

#### 3.1.3 Annealing Data

Empirically, we find that annealing (see Section 3.4.3) on small amounts of high-quality code and mathematical data can boost the performance of pre-trained models on key benchmarks. Akin to Li et al. (2024b), we perform annealing with a data mix that upsamples high-quality data in select domains. We do not include any training sets from commonly used benchmarks in our annealing data. This enables us to assess the true few-shot learning capabilities and out-of-domain generalization of Llama 3.

Following OpenAI (2023a), we evaluate the efficacy of annealing on the GSM8k (Cobbe et al., 2021) and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b) training sets in annealing. We find that annealing improved the performance of a pre-trained Llama 3 8B model on the GSM8k and MATH validation sets by 24.0% and 6.4%, respectively. However, the improvements on the 405B model are negligible, suggesting that our flagship model has strong in-context learning and reasoning capabilities and does not require specific in-domain training samples to obtain strong performance.

Using annealing to assess data quality. Similar to Blakeney et al. (2024), we find that annealing enables us to judge the value of small domain-specific datasets. We measure the value of such datasets by annealing the learning rate of a 50% trained Llama 3 8B model linearly to 0 on 40B tokens. In those experiments, we assign 30% weight to the new dataset and the remaining 70% weight to the default data mix. Using annealing to evaluate new data sources is more efficient than performing scaling law experiments for every small dataset.

### 3.2 Model Architecture

Llama 3 uses a standard, dense Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). It does not deviate significantly from Llama and Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023a,b) in terms of model architecture; our performance gains are primarily driven by improvements in data quality and diversity as well as by increased training scale.

We make a few small modifications compared to Llama 2:

- We use grouped query attention (GQA; Ainslie et al. (2023)) with 8 key-value heads to improve inference speed and to reduce the size of key-value caches during decoding.
- We use an attention mask that prevents self-attention between different documents within the same sequence. We find that this change had limited impact during in standard pre-training, but find it to be important in continued pre-training on very long sequences.

Table 3 Overview of the key hyperparameters of Llama 3. We display settings for 8B, 70B, and 405B language models.

- We use a vocabulary with 128K tokens. Our token vocabulary combines 100K tokens from the tiktoken3 tokenizer with 28K additional tokens to better support non-English languages. Compared to the Llama 2 tokenizer, our new tokenizer improves compression rates on a sample of English data from 3.17 to 3.94 characters per token. This enables the model to "read" more text for the same amount of training compute. We also found that adding 28K tokens from select non-English languages improved both compression ratios and downstream performance, with no impact on English tokenization.
- We increase the RoPE base frequency hyperparameter to 500,000. This enables us to better support longer contexts; Xiong et al. (2023) showed this value to be effective for context lengths up to 32,768.

Llama 3 405B uses an architecture with 126 layers, a token representation dimension of 16,384, and 128 attention heads; see Table 3 for details. This leads to a model size that is approximately compute-optimal according to scaling laws on our data for our training budget of 3.8 × 1025 FLOPs.

#### 3.2.1 Scaling Laws

We develop scaling laws (Hoffmann et al., 2022; Kaplan et al., 2020) to determine the optimal model size for our flagship model given our pre-training compute budget. In addition to determining the optimal model size, a major challenge is to forecast the flagship model's performance on downstream benchmark tasks, due to a couple of issues: (1) Existing scaling laws typically predict only next-token prediction loss rather than specific benchmark performance. (2) Scaling laws can be noisy and unreliable because they are developed based on pre-training runs conducted with small compute budgets (Wei et al., 2022b).

To address these challenges, we implement a two-stage methodology to develop scaling laws that accurately predict downstream benchmark performance:

- 1. We first establish a correlation between the compute-optimal model's negative log-likelihood on downstream tasks and the training FLOPs.
- 2. Next, we correlate the negative log-likelihood on downstream tasks with task accuracy, utilizing both the scaling law models and older models trained with higher compute FLOPs. In this step, we specifically leverage the Llama 2 family of models.

This approach enables us to predict downstream task performance given a specific number of training FLOPs for compute-optimal models. We use a similar method to select our pre-training data mix (see Section 3.4).

Scaling law experiments. Concretely, we construct our scaling laws by pre-training models using compute budgets between 6 × 1018 FLOPs and 1022 FLOPs. At each compute budget, we pre-train models ranging in size between 40M and 16B parameters, using a subset of model sizes at each compute budget. In these training runs, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with a linear warmup for 2,000 training steps. The peak learning rate is set between 2 × 10−4 and 4 × 10−4 depending on the size of the model. We set the cosine decay to 0.1 of the peak value. The weight decay at each step is set to 0.1 times the learning rate at that step. We use a fixed batch size for each compute scale, ranging between 250K and 4M.

![](_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg)

Figure 3 Number of training tokens in identified computeoptimal models as a function of pre-training compute budget. We include the fitted scaling-law prediction as well. The compute-optimal models correspond to the parabola minimums in Figure 2.

These experiments give rise to the IsoFLOPs curves in Figure 2. The loss in these curves is measured on a separate validation set. We fit the measured loss values using a second-degree polynomial and identify the minimums of each parabola. We refer to minimum of a parabola as the compute-optimal model at the corresponding pre-training compute budget.

We use the compute-optimal models we identified this way to predict the optimal number of training tokens for a specific compute budget. To do so, we assume a power-law relation between compute budget, C, and the optimal number of training tokens, N⋆ (C):

$$N^{\star}(C)=A C^{\alpha}.$$

We fit A and α using the data from Figure 2. We find that (α, A) = (0.53, 0.29); the corresponding fit is shown in Figure 3. Extrapolation of the resulting scaling law to 3.8 × 1025 FLOPs suggests training a 402B parameter model on 16.55T tokens.

An important observation is that IsoFLOPs curves become flatter around the minimum as the compute budget increases. This implies that performance of the flagship model is relatively robust to small changes in the trade-off between model size and training tokens. Based on this observation, we ultimately decided to train a flagship model with 405B parameters.

Predicting performance on downstream tasks. We use the resulting compute-optimal models to forecast the performance of the flagship Llama 3 model on benchmark data sets. First, we linearly correlate the (normalized) negative log-likelihood of correct answer in the benchmark and the training FLOPs. In this analysis, we use only the scaling law models trained up to 1022 FLOPs on the data mix described above. Next, we establish a sigmoidal relation between the log-likelihood and accuracy using both the scaling law models and Llama 2 models, which were trained using the Llama 2 data mix and tokenizer. We show the results of this experiment on the ARC Challenge benchmark in Figure 4). We find this two-step scaling law prediction, which extrapolates over four orders of magnitude, to be quite accurate: it only slightly underestimates the final performance of the flagship Llama 3 model.

#### 3.3 Infrastructure, Scaling, and Efficiency

We describe our hardware and infrastructure that powered Llama 3 405B pre-training at scale and discuss several optimizations that leads to improvements in training efficiency.

#### 3.3.1 Training Infrastructure

The Llama 1 and 2 models were trained on Meta's AI Research SuperCluster (Lee and Sengupta, 2022). As we scaled further, the training for Llama 3 was migrated to Meta's production clusters (Lee et al., 2024).This

Right: ARC Challenge benchmark accuracy as a function of the normalized negative log-likelihood of the correct answer. This analysis enables us to predict model performance on the ARC Challenge benchmark before pre-training commences. See text for details.

setup optimizes for production-grade reliability, which is essential as we scale up training.

Compute. Llama 3 405B is trained on up to 16K H100 GPUs, each running at 700W TDP with 80GB HBM3, using Meta's Grand Teton AI server platform (Matt Bowman, 2022). Each server is equipped with eight GPUs and two CPUs. Within a server, the eight GPUs are connected via NVLink. Training jobs are scheduled using MAST (Choudhury et al., 2024), Meta's global-scale training scheduler.

Storage. Tectonic (Pan et al., 2021), Meta's general-purpose distributed file system, is used to build a storage fabric (Battey and Gupta, 2024) for Llama 3 pre-training. It offers 240 PB of storage out of 7,500 servers equipped with SSDs, and supports a sustainable throughput of 2 TB/s and a peak throughput of 7 TB/s. A major challenge is supporting the highly bursty checkpoint writes that saturate the storage fabric for short durations. Checkpointing saves each GPU's model state, ranging from 1 MB to 4 GB per GPU, for recovery and debugging. We aim to minimize GPU pause time during checkpointing and increase checkpoint frequency to reduce the amount of lost work after a recovery.

Network. Llama 3 405B used RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) fabric based on the Arista 7800 and Minipack2 Open Compute Project4 OCP rack switches. Smaller models in the Llama 3 family were trained using Nvidia Quantum2 Infiniband fabric. Both RoCE and Infiniband clusters leverage 400 Gbps interconnects between GPUs. Despite the underlying network technology differences between these clusters, we tune both of them to provide equivalent performance for these large training workloads. We elaborate further on our RoCE network since we fully own its design.

- Network topology. Our RoCE-based AI cluster comprises 24K GPUs5 connected by a three-layer Clos network (Lee et al., 2024). At the bottom layer, each rack hosts 16 GPUs split between two servers and connected by a single Minipack2 top-of-the-rack (ToR) switch. In the middle layer, 192 such racks are connected by Cluster Switches to form a pod of 3,072 GPUs with full bisection bandwidth, ensuring no oversubscription. At the top layer, eight such pods within the same datacenter building are connected via Aggregation Switches to form a cluster of 24K GPUs. However, network connectivity at the aggregation layer does not maintain full bisection bandwidth and instead has an oversubscription ratio of 1:7. Our model parallelism methods (see Section 3.3.2) and training job scheduler (Choudhury et al., 2024) are all optimized to be aware of network topology, aiming to minimize network communication across pods.
- Load balancing. LLM training produces fat network flows that are hard to load balance across all available network paths using traditional methods such as Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing. To address this challenge, we employ two techniques. First, our collective library creates 16 network flows between two GPUs, instead of just one, thereby reducing the traffic per flow and providing more flows

for load balancing. Second, our Enhanced-ECMP (E-ECMP) protocol effectively balances these 16 flows across different network paths by hashing on additional fields in the RoCE header of packets.

- Congestion control. We use deep-buffer switches in the spine (Gangidi et al., 2024) to accommodate transient congestion and buffering caused by collective communication patterns. This setup helps limit the impact of persistent congestion and network back pressure caused by slow servers, which is common in training. Finally, better load balancing through E-ECMP significantly reduces the chance of congestion. With these optimizations, we successfully run a 24K GPU cluster without traditional congestion control methods such as Data Center Quantized Congestion Notification (DCQCN).
#### 3.3.2 Parallelism for Model Scaling

To scale training for our largest models, we use 4D parallelism—a combination of four different types of parallelism methods—to shard the model. This approach efficiently distributes computation across many GPUs and ensures each GPU's model parameters, optimizer states, gradients, and activations fit in its HBM. Our implementation of 4D parallelism is illustrated in Figure 5. It combines tensor parallelism (TP; Krizhevsky et al. (2012); Shoeybi et al. (2019); Korthikanti et al. (2023)), pipeline parallelism (PP; Huang et al. (2019); Narayanan et al. (2021); Lamy-Poirier (2023)), context parallelism (CP; Liu et al. (2023a)), and data parallelism (DP; Rajbhandari et al. (2020); Ren et al. (2021); Zhao et al. (2023b)).

Tensor parallelism splits individual weight tensors into multiple chunks on different devices. Pipeline parallelism partitions the model vertically into stages by layers, so that different devices can process in parallel different stages of the full model pipeline. Context parallelism divides the input context into segments, reducing memory bottleneck for very long sequence length inputs. We use fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP; Rajbhandari et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2023b), which shards the model, optimizer, and gradients while implementing data parallelism which processes data in parallel on multiple GPUs and synchronizes after each training step. Our use of FSDP for Llama 3 shards optimizer states and gradients, but for model shards we do not reshard after forward computation to avoid an extra all-gather communication during backward passes.

GPU utilization. Through careful tuning of the parallelism configuration, hardware, and software, we achieve an overall BF16 Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU; Chowdhery et al. (2023)) of 38-43% for the configurations shown in Table 4. The slight drop in MFU to 41% on 16K GPUs with DP=128 compared to 43% on 8K GPUs with DP=64 is due to the lower batch size per DP group needed to keep the global tokens per batch constant during training.

Pipeline parallelism improvements. We encountered several challenges with existing implementations:

- Batch size constraint. Current implementations have constraints on supported batch size per GPU, requiring it to be divisible by the number of pipeline stages. For the example in Figure 6, the depth-first schedule (DFS) of pipeline parallelism (Narayanan et al., 2021) requires N = PP = 4, while the breadth-first schedule (BFS; Lamy-Poirier (2023)) requires N = M, where M is the total number of micro-batches and N is the number of contiguous micro-batches for the same stage's forward or backward. However, pre-training often needs flexibility to adjust batch size.
- Memory imbalance. Existing pipeline parallelism implementations lead to imbalanced resource consumption. The first stage consumes more memory due to the embedding and the warm-up micro-batches.
- Computation imbalance. After the last layer of the model, we need to calculate output and loss, making this stage the execution latency bottleneck.

![](_page_10_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 5 Illustration of 4D parallelism. GPUs are divided into parallelism groups in the order of [TP, CP, PP, DP], where DP stands for FSDP. In this example, 16 GPUs are configured with a group size of |TP|=2, |CP|=2, |PP|=2, and |DP|=2. A GPU's position in 4D parallelism is represented as a vector, [D1, D2, D3, D4], where Di is the index on the i-th parallelism dimension. In this example, GPU0[TP0, CP0, PP0, DP0] and GPU1[TP1, CP0, PP0, DP0] are in the same TP group, GPU0 and GPU2 are in the same CP group, GPU0 and GPU4 are in the same PP group, and GPU0 and GPU8 are in the same DP group.

To address these issues, we modify our pipeline schedule as shown in Figure 6, which allows setting N flexibly—in this case N = 5, which can run a arbitrary number of micro-batches in each batch. This allows us to run: (1) fewer micro-batches than the number of stages when we have batch size limit at large scale; or (2) more micro-batches to hide point-to-point communication, finding a sweet spot between DFS and breadth first schedule (BFS) for the best communication and memory efficiency. To balance the pipeline, we reduce one Transformer layer each from the first and the last stages, respectively. This means that the first model chunk on the first stage has only the embedding, and the last model chunk on the last stage has only output projection and loss calculation. To reduce pipeline bubbles, we use an interleaved schedule (Narayanan et al., 2021) with V pipeline stages on one pipeline rank. Overall pipeline bubble ratio is PP−1 V ∗M . Further, we adopt asynchronous point-to-point communication in PP, which considerably speeds up training, especially in cases when the document mask introduces extra computation imbalance. We enable TORCH_NCCL_AVOID_RECORD_STREAMS to reduce memory usage from asynchronous point-to-point communication. Finally, to reduce memory cost, based on detailed memory allocation profiling, we proactively deallocate tensors that will not be used for future computation, including the input and output tensors of each pipeline stage, that will not be used for future computation. With these optimizations, we could pre-train Llama 3 on sequences of 8K tokens without activation checkpointing.

Context parallelism for long sequences. We utilize context parallelism (CP) to improve memory efficiency when scaling the context length of Llama 3 and enable training on extremely long sequences up to 128K in length. In CP, we partition across the sequence dimension, and specifically we partition the input sequence into 2 × CP chunks so each CP rank receives two chunks for better load balancing. The i-th CP rank received both the i-th and the (2 × CP − 1 − i)-th chunks.

Different from existing CP implementations that overlap communication and computation in a ring-like structure (Liu et al., 2023a), our CP implementation adopts an all-gather based method where we first all-gather the key (K) and value (V) tensors, and then compute attention output for the local query (Q) tensor chunk. Although the all-gather communication latency is exposed in the critical path, we still adopt this approach for two main reasons: (1) it is easier and more flexible to support different types of attention masks in all-gather based CP attention, such as the document mask; and (2) the exposed all-gather latency

![](_page_11_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 6 Illustration of pipeline parallelism in Llama 3. Pipeline parallelism partitions eight pipeline stages (0 to 7) across four pipeline ranks (PP ranks 0 to 3), where the GPUs with rank 0 run stages 0 and 4, the GPUs with P rank 1 run stages 1 and 5, etc. The colored blocks (0 to 9) represent a sequence of micro-batches, where M is the total number of micro-batches and N is the number of continuous micro-batches for the same stage's forward or backward. Our key insight is to make N tunable.

is small as the communicated K and V tensors are much smaller than Q tensor due to the use of GQA (Ainslie et al., 2023). Hence, the time complexity of attention computation is an order of magnitude larger than all-gather (O(S 2 ) versus O(S), where S represents the sequence length in the full causal mask), making the all-gather overhead negligible.

Network-aware parallelism configuration. The order of parallelism dimensions, [TP, CP, PP, DP], is optimized for network communication. The innermost parallelism requires the highest network bandwidth and lowest latency, and hence is usually constrained to within the same server. The outermost parallelism may spread across a multi-hop network and should tolerate higher network latency. Therefore, based on the requirements for network bandwidth and latency, we place parallelism dimensions in the order of [TP, CP, PP, DP]. DP (i.e., FSDP) is the outermost parallelism because it can tolerate longer network latency by asynchronously prefetching sharded model weights and reducing gradients. Identifying the optimal parallelism configuration with minimal communication overhead while avoiding GPU memory overflow is challenging. We develop a memory consumption estimator and a performance-projection tool which helped us explore various parallelism configurations and project overall training performance and identify memory gaps effectively.

Numerical stability. By comparing training loss between different parallelism setups, we fixed several numerical issues that impact training stability. To ensure training convergence, we use FP32 gradient accumulation during backward computation over multiple micro-batches and also reduce-scatter gradients in FP32 across data parallel workers in FSDP. For intermediate tensors, e.g., vision encoder outputs, that are used multiple times in the forward computation, the backward gradients are also accumulated in FP32.

#### 3.3.3 Collective Communication

Our collective communication library for Llama 3 is based on a fork of Nvidia's NCCL library, called NCCLX. NCCLX significantly improves the performance of NCCL, especially for higher latency networks. Recall that the order of parallelism dimensions is [TP, CP, PP, DP], where DP corresponds to FSDP. The outermost parallelism dimensions, PP and DP, may communicate through a multi-hop network, with latency up to tens of microseconds. The original NCCL collectives—all-gather and reduce-scatter in FSDP, and point-to-point in PP—require data chunking and staged data copy. This approach incurs several inefficiencies, including (1) requiring a large number of small control messages to be exchanged over the network to facilitate data transfer, (2) extra memory-copy operations, and (3) using extra GPU cycles for communication. For Llama 3 training, we address a subset of these inefficiencies by tuning chunking and data transfer to fit our network latencies, which can be as high as tens of microseconds for a large cluster. We also allow small control messages to traverse our network at a higher priority, especially avoiding being head-of-line blocked in deep-buffer core switches. Our ongoing work for future Llama versions involves making deeper changes in NCCLX to holistically address all the aforementioned problems.

Table 5 Root-cause categorization of unexpected interruptions during a 54-day period of Llama 3 405B pre-training. About 78% of unexpected interruptions were attributed to confirmed or suspected hardware issues.

#### 3.3.4 Reliability and Operational Challenges

The complexity and potential failure scenarios of 16K GPU training surpass those of much larger CPU clusters that we have operated. Moreover, the synchronous nature of training makes it less fault-tolerant—a single GPU failure may require a restart of the entire job. Despite these challenges, for Llama 3, we achieved higher than 90% effective training time while supporting automated cluster maintenance, such as firmware and Linux kernel upgrades (Vigraham and Leonhardi, 2024), which resulted in at least one training interruption daily. The effective training time measures the time spent on useful training over the elapsed time.

During a 54-day snapshot period of pre-training, we experienced a total of 466 job interruptions. Of these, 47 were planned interruptions due to automated maintenance operations such as firmware upgrades or operatorinitiated operations like configuration or dataset updates. The remaining 419 were unexpected interruptions, which are classified in Table 5. Approximately 78% of the unexpected interruptions are attributed to confirmed hardware issues, such as GPU or host component failures, or suspected hardware-related issues like silent data corruption and unplanned individual host maintenance events. GPU issues are the largest category, accounting for 58.7% of all unexpected issues. Despite the large number of failures, significant manual intervention was required only three times during this period, with the rest of issues handled by automation.

To increase the effective training time, we reduced job startup and checkpointing time, and developed tools for fast diagnosis and problem resolution. We extensively use PyTorch's built-in NCCL flight recorder (Ansel et al., 2024), a feature that captures collective metadata and stack traces into a ring buffer, and hence allowing us to diagnose hangs and performance issues quickly at scale, particularly with regard to NCCLX. Using this, we efficiently record every communication event and the duration of each collective operation, and also automatically dump tracing data on NCCLX watchdog or heartbeat timeout. We enable more computationally intensive tracing operations and metadata collection selectively as needed live in production through online configuration changes (Tang et al., 2015) without needing a code release or job restart.

Debugging issues in large-scale training is complicated by the mixed use of NVLink and RoCE in our network. Data transfer over NVLink typically occurs through load/store operations issued by CUDA kernels, and failures in either the remote GPU or NVLink connectivity often manifest as stalled load/store operations within CUDA kernels without returning a clear error code. NCCLX enhances the speed and accuracy of failure

detection and localization through a tight co-design with PyTorch, allowing PyTorch to access NCCLX's internal state and track relevant information. While stalls due to NVLink failures cannot be completely prevented, our system monitors the state of the communication library and automatically times out when such a stall is detected. Additionally, NCCLX traces the kernel and network activities of each NCCLX communication and provides a snapshot of the failing NCCLX collective's internal state, including finished and pending data transfers between all ranks. We analyze this data to debug NCCLX scaling issues.

Sometimes, hardware issues may cause still-functioning but slow stragglers that are hard to detect. Even a single straggler can slow down thousands of other GPUs, often appearing as functioning but slow communications. We developed tools to prioritize potentially problematic communications from selected process groups. By investigating just a few top suspects, we were usually able to effectively identify the stragglers.

One interesting observation is the impact of environmental factors on training performance at scale. For Llama 3 405B , we noted a diurnal 1-2% throughput variation based on time-of-day. This fluctuation is the result of higher mid-day temperatures impacting GPU dynamic voltage and frequency scaling.

During training, tens of thousands of GPUs may increase or decrease power consumption at the same time, for example, due to all GPUs waiting for checkpointing or collective communications to finish, or the startup or shutdown of the entire training job. When this happens, it can result in instant fluctuations of power consumption across the data center on the order of tens of megawatts, stretching the limits of the power grid. This is an ongoing challenge for us as we scale training for future, even larger Llama models.

### 3.4 Training Recipe

The recipe used to pre-train Llama 3 405B consists of three main stages: (1) initial pre-training, (2) long-context pre-training, and (3) annealing. The three stages are described separately below. We use similar recipes to pre-train the 8B and 70B models.

### 3.4.1 Initial Pre-Training

We pre-train Llama 3 405B using AdamW with a peak learning rate of 8 × 10−5 , a linear warm up of 8,000 steps, and a cosine learning rate schedule decaying to 8 × 10−7 over 1,200,000 steps. We use a lower batch size early in training to improve training stability, and increase it subsequently to improve efficiency. Specifically, we use an initial batch size of 4M tokens and sequences of length 4,096, and double these values to a batch size of 8M sequences of 8,192 tokens after pre-training 252M tokens. We double the batch size again to 16M after pre-training on 2.87T tokens. We found this training recipe to be very stable: we observed few loss spikes and did not require interventions to correct for model training divergence.

Adjusting the data mix. We made a several adjustments to the pre-training data mix during training to improve model performance on particular downstream tasks. In particular, we increased the percentage of non-English data during pre-training to improve the multilingual performance of Llama 3. We also upsample mathematical data to improve the model's mathematical reasoning performance, we added more recent web data in the later stages of pre-training to advance the model's knowledge cut-off, and we downsampled subsets of the pre-training data that were later identified as being lower quality.

### 3.4.2 Long Context Pre-Training

In the final stages of pre-training, we train on long sequences to support context windows of up to 128K tokens. We do not train on long sequences earlier because the compute in self-attention layers grows quadratically in the sequence length. We increase the supported context length in increments, pre-training until the model has successfully adapted to the increased context length. We assess successful adaptation by measuring whether (1) model performance on short-context evaluations has recovered completely and (2) the model perfectly solves "needle in a haystack" tasks up to that length. In Llama 3 405B pre-training, we increased context length gradually in six stages, starting from the original 8K context window and ending in the final 128K context window. This long-context pre-training stage was performed using approximately 800B training tokens.

![](_page_14_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 7 Illustration of the overall post-training approach for Llama 3. Our post-training strategy involves rejection sampling, supervised finetuning, and direct preference optimization. See text for details.

#### 3.4.3 Annealing

During pre-training on the final 40M tokens, we linearly annealed the learning rate to 0, maintaining a context length of 128K tokens. During this annealing phase, we also adjusted the data mix to upsample data sources of very high quality; see Section 3.1.3. Finally, we compute the average of model checkpoints (Polyak (1991) averaging) during annealing to produce the final pre-trained model.

### 4 Post-Training

We produce the aligned Llama 3 models by applying several rounds of post-training,6 or aligning the model with human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022; Rafailov et al., 2024) on top of a pre-trained checkpoint. Each round of post-training involves supervised finetuning (SFT) followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2024) on examples collected either via human annotations or generated synthetically. Our post-training modeling and data approaches are described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 respectively. We further detail custom data curation strategies to improve the reasoning, coding, factuality, multilingual, tool use, long context, and precise instruction following in Section 4.3.

### 4.1 Modeling

The backbone of our post-training strategy is a reward model and a language model. We first train a reward model on top of the pre-trained checkpoint using human-annotated preference data (see Section 4.1.2). We then finetune pre-trained checkpoints with supervised finetuning (SFT; see Section 4.1.3), and further align the checkpoints with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; see Section 4.1.4). This process is illustrated in Figure 7. Unless otherwise noted, our modeling procedure applies to Llama 3 405B, and we refer to Llama 3 405B as Llama 3 for simplicity.

#### 4.1.1 Chat Dialog Format

To tune LLMs for human-AI interaction, we need to define a chat dialog protocol for the model to understand human instructions and perform conversational tasks. Compared to its predecessor, Llama 3 has new capabilities such as tool use (Section 4.3.5) which may require generating multiple messages and sending

<sup>6</sup>We use the term "post-training" to refer to any model training that happens outside of pre-training.

them to different locations (e.g., user, ipython) within a single dialog turn. To support this, we design a new multi-message chat protocol which uses various special header and termination tokens. The header tokens are used to indicate the source and destination of each message in a conversation. Similarly, the termination tokens indicate when it is the time to alternate between human and AI to speak.

#### 4.1.2 Reward Modeling

We train a reward model (RM) covering different capabilities on top of the pre-trained checkpoint. The training objective is the same as Llama 2 except that we remove the margin term in the loss, as we observe diminishing improvements after data scaling. Following Llama 2, we use all of our preference data for reward modeling after filtering out samples with similar responses. In addition to standard preference pair of (chosen, rejected) response, annotations also create a third "edited response" for some prompts, where the chosen response from the pair is further edited for improvement (see Section 4.2.1). Hence, each preference ranking sample has two or three responses with clear ranking (edited > chosen > rejected). We concatenate the prompt and multiple responses into a single row during training with responses randomly shuffled. This is an approximation to the standard scenario of putting the responses in separate rows and computing the scores, but in our ablations, this approach improves training efficiency without a loss in accuracy.

#### 4.1.3 Supervised Finetuning

The reward model is then used to perform rejection sampling on our human annotation prompts, the details of which are described in Section 4.2. Together with this rejection-sampled data and other data sources (including synthetic data), we finetune the pre-trained language model using a standard cross entropy loss on the target tokens (while masking loss on prompt tokens). More details about the data mix can be found in Section 4.2. We refer to this stage as supervised finetuning (SFT; Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022b), even though many of the training targets are model-generated. Our largest models are finetuned with a learning rate of 10−5 over the course of 8.5K to 9K steps. We found these hyperparameter settings to work well across different rounds and data mixes.

#### 4.1.4 Direct Preference Optimization

We further train our SFT models with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2024) for human preference alignment. For training, we primarily use the most recent batches of preference data collected using the best performing models from the previous alignment rounds. As a result, our training data conforms better to the distribution of the policy model that is being optimized in each round. We also explored on-policy algorithms such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), but found that DPO required less compute for large-scale models and performed better, especially on instruction following benchmarks like IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023). For Llama 3, we use a learning rate of 10−5 and set the β hyper-parameter to be 0.1. In addition, we apply the following algorithmic modifications to DPO:

- Masking out formatting tokens in DPO loss: We mask out special formatting tokens including header and termination tokens (described in Section 4.1.1) from both chosen and rejected responses in the loss to stabilize DPO training. We observe that having these tokens contribute to the loss may lead to undesired model behaviors such as tail repetition or abruptly generating termination tokens. We hypothesize that this is due to the contrastive nature of the DPO loss – the presence of common tokens in both chosen and rejected responses leads to a conflicting learning objective as the model needs to increase and reduce the likelihood of these tokens simultaneously.
- Regularization with NLL loss: We add an additional negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss term with a scaling coefficient of 0.2 on the chosen sequences, similar to Pang et al. (2024). This helps further stabilize DPO training by maintaining desired formatting for generation and preventing the decrease of log probability of chosen responses (Pang et al., 2024; Pal et al., 2024).

#### 4.1.5 Model Averaging

Finally, we average models obtained from experiments using various versions of data or hyperparameters at each RM, SFT, or DPO stage (Izmailov et al., 2019; Wortsman et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022).

|  | % of | Avg. # turns | Avg. # tokens | Avg. # tokens | Avg. # tokens |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dataset | comparisons | per dialog | per example | in prompt | in response |
| General English | 81.99% | 4.1 | 1,000.4 | 36.4 | 271.2 |
| Coding | 6.93% | 3.2 | 1,621.0 | 113.8 | 462.9 |
| Multilingual | 5.19% | 1.8 | 1,299.4 | 77.1 | 420.9 |
| Reasoning and tools | 5.89% | 1.6 | 707.7 | 46.6 | 129.9 |
| Total | 100% | 3.8 | 1,041.6 | 44.5 | 284.0 |

Table 6 Statistics of human preference data. We list statistics of the internally collected human preference data used for Llama 3 alignment. We ask annotators to perform multi-turn dialogues with the models and make comparisons among responses at each turn. In post-processing, we split each dialogue to multiple examples at a turn level. Each example consists of a prompt (including previous dialog if available) and a response (e.g., chosen or rejected response).

#### 4.1.6 Iterative Rounds

Following Llama 2, we apply the above methods in six rounds. In each cycle, we collect new preference annotations and SFT data, sampling synthetic data from the latest models.

#### 4.2 Post-training Data

The post-training data composition plays a critical role in the usefulness and behavior of language models. In this section, we discuss our human annotation procedures and preference data collection (Section 4.2.1), the composition of our SFT data (Section 4.2.2), and methods for data quality control and cleaning (Section 4.2.3).

#### 4.2.1 Preference Data

Our preference data annotation process is similar to Llama 2. We deploy multiple models for annotation after each round and sample two responses from two different models for each user prompt. These models can be trained with different data mixes and alignment recipes, allowing for different capability strength (e.g., code expertise) and increased data diversity. We ask annotators to rate the strength of their preference by categorizing it into one of four levels, based on how much more they prefer the chosen response over the rejected one: significantly better, better, slightly better, or marginally better. We also incorporate an editing step after preference ranking to encourage annotators to further improve the preferred response. Annotators edit the chosen response directly or prompt the model with feedback to refine its own response. Consequently, a portion of our preference data has three responses ranked (edited > chosen > rejected).

In Table 6, we report the statistics of preference annotations that we use for Llama 3 training. General English covers multiple subcategories such as knowledge-based question and answering or precise instruction-following, which fall outside the scope of specific capabilities. Compared to Llama 2, we observe an increase in the average length of prompt and response, suggesting that we train Llama 3 on more complex tasks. In addition, we implement a quality analysis and human evaluation process to rigorously assess the data collected, allowing us to refine our prompts and provide systematic, actionable feedback to annotators. For example, as Llama 3 improves after each round, we increase prompt complexity accordingly to target areas where the model lags.

In each round of post-training, we use all the preference data that is available at the time for reward modeling, while only using the latest batches from various capabilities for DPO training. For both reward modeling and DPO, we use samples that are labeled as the chosen response being significantly better or better than the rejected counterpart for training and discard samples with similar responses.

#### 4.2.2 SFT Data

Our finetuning data is largely comprised of the following sources:

- Prompts from our human annotation collection with rejection-sampled responses.
- Synthetic data targeting specific capabilities (see Section 4.3 for more details).

|  |  |  |  | Avg. # tokens | Avg. # tokens |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dataset | % of examples | Avg. # turns | Avg. # tokens | in context | in final response |
| General English | 52.66% | 6.3 | 974.0 | 656.7 | 317.1 |
| Code | 14.89% | 2.7 | 753.3 | 378.8 | 374.5 |
| Multilingual | 3.01% | 2.7 | 520.5 | 230.8 | 289.7 |
| Exam-like | 8.14% | 2.3 | 297.8 | 124.4 | 173.4 |
| Reasoning and tools | 21.19% | 3.1 | 661.6 | 359.8 | 301.9 |
| Long context | 0.11% | 6.7 | 38,135.6 | 37,395.2 | 740.5 |
| Total | 100% | 4.7 | 846.1 | 535.7 | 310.4 |

Table 7 Statistics of SFT data. We list internally collected SFT data used for Llama 3 alignment. Each SFT example consists of a context (i.e., all conversation turns except the last one) and a final response.

- Small amounts of human-curated data (see Section 4.3 for more details).
As our post-training rounds progress, we develop stronger Llama 3 variants that we use to collect larger datasets that cover a wide range of complex capabilities. In this section, we discuss the details for the rejection-sampling procedure and overall composition of our final SFT datamix.

Rejection sampling. During rejection sampling (RS), for each prompt collected during human annotation (Section 4.2.1) we sample K (typically between 10 and 30) outputs from the latest chat model policy (usually the best performing checkpoint from the previous post-training iteration, or the best performing checkpoint for a particular capability) and use our reward model to select the best candidate, consistent with Bai et al. (2022). In later rounds of post-training, we introduce system prompts to steer RS responses to conform with desirable tone, style, or formatting, which might be different for different capabilities.

To increase the efficiency of rejection sampling, we adopt PagedAttention (Kwon et al., 2023). PagedAttention enhances memory efficiency through dynamic key-value cache allocation. It supports arbitrary output lengths by dynamically scheduling requests based on the current cache capacity. Unfortunately, this carries the risk of swap-out when running out of memory. To eliminate such swap overhead, we define a maximum output length and perform a request only if sufficient memory is available to fit an output with that length. PagedAttention also enables us to share the key-value cache pages for a prompt across all corresponding outputs. Together, this leads to a throughput improvement of over 2× during rejection sampling.

Overall data composition. Table 7 shows data statistics for each broad category of our "helpfulness" mix. While SFT and preference data contain overlapping domains, they are curated differently, yielding distinct count statistics. In Section 4.2.3 we describe techniques for categorizing topic, complexity, and quality of our data samples. In each round of post-training, we adjust our overall data mix carefully across these axes to tune performance across a wide range of benchmarks. Our final data mix epochs multiple times on some high quality sources and downsamples others.

#### 4.2.3 Data Processing and Quality Control

Given that most of our training data is model-generated, it requires careful cleaning and quality control.

Data cleaning. In the early rounds, we observed a number of undesirable patterns common in our data, such as excessive use of emojis or exclamation points. Therefore, we implement a series of rule-based data removal and modification strategies to filter or clean problematic data. For example, to mitigate overly-apologetic tonal issues, we identify overused phrases (such as "I'm sorry" or "I apologize") and carefully balance the proportion of such samples in our dataset.

Data pruning. We also apply a collection of model-based techniques to remove low-quality training samples and improve overall model performance:

- Topic classification: We first finetune Llama 3 8B into a topic classifier, and perform inference over all data to classify it into both coarsely-grained buckets ("mathematical reasoning") and fine-grained
buckets ("geometry and trigonometry").

- Quality scoring: We use both reward model and Llama-based signals to obtain a quality score for each sample. For an RM-based score, we consider data that is in the top quartile of RM scores as high quality. For a Llama-based score, we prompt Llama 3 checkpoint to rate each sample on a three-point scale for general English data (accuracy, instruction following, and tone/presentation) and a two-point scale for coding data (bug identification and user intention), and consider samples that obtain the maximum score as high quality. The RM and Llama-based scores have high disagreement rates, and we find that combining these signals yield the best recall on our internal test set. Ultimately, we select examples that are marked as high quality by the RM or the Llama-based filter.
- Difficulty scoring: Because we are also interested in prioritizing examples that are more complex for the model, we score data using two measures of difficulty: Instag (Lu et al., 2023) and Llama-based scoring. For Instag, we prompt Llama 3 70B to perform intention tagging of SFT prompts, where more intentions implies more complexity. We also prompt Llama 3 to measure the difficulty (Liu et al., 2024c) of dialogs on a three-point scale.
- Semantic deduplication: Finally, we perform semantic deduplication (Abbas et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024c). We first cluster complete dialogs using RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b) and within each cluster sort them by quality score × difficulty score. We then do greedy selection by iterating through all sorted examples, and only keeping the ones that have maximum cosine similarity less than a threshold to the examples seen so far in the cluster.

### 4.3 Capabilities

We highlight special efforts to improve performance for specific capabilities such as code (Section 4.3.1), multilinguality (Section 4.3.2), math and reasoning (Section 4.3.3), long context (Section 4.3.4), tool use (Section 4.3.5), factuality (Section 4.3.6), and steerability (Section 4.3.7).

### 4.3.1 Code

LLMs for code have received significant attention since the release of Copilot and Codex (Chen et al., 2021). Developers are now widely using these models to generate code snippets, debug, automate tasks, and improve code quality. For Llama 3, we target improving and evaluating code generation, documentation, debugging, and review capabilities for the following high priority programming languages: Python, Java, Javascript, C/C++, Typescript, Rust, PHP, HTML/CSS, SQL, bash/shell. Here, we present our work on improving these coding capabilities via training a code expert, generating synthetic data for SFT, improving formatting with system prompt steering, and creating quality filters to remove bad samples from our training data.

Expert training. We train a code expert which we use to collect high quality human annotations for code throughout subsequent rounds of post-training. This is accomplished by branching the main pre-training run and continuing pre-training on a 1T token mix of mostly (>85%) code data. Continued pre-training on domainspecific data has been shown to be effective for improving performance in a specific domain (Gururangan et al., 2020). We follow a recipe similar to that of CodeLlama (Rozière et al., 2023). For the last several thousand steps of training we perform long-context finetuning (LCFT) to extend the expert's context length to 16K tokens on a high quality mix of repo-level code data. Finally, we follow the similar post-training modeling recipes described in Section 4.1 to align this model, except with SFT and DPO data mixes primarily targeting code. This model is also used for rejection sampling (Section 4.2.2) for coding prompts.

Synthetic data generation. During development, we identified key issues in code generation, including difficulty in following instructions, code syntax errors, incorrect code generation, and difficulty in fixing bugs. While intensive human annotation could theoretically resolve these issues, synthetic data generation offers a complementary approach at a lower cost and higher scale, unconstrained by the expertise level of annotators. As such, we use Llama 3 and the code expert to generate a large quantity of synthetic SFT dialogs.

We describe three high-level approaches for generating synthetic code data. In total, we generate over 2.7M synthetic examples which were used during SFT.

- 1. Synthetic data generation: execution feedback. The 8B and 70B models show significant performance improvements when trained on data generated by a larger, more competent model. However, our initial experiments revealed that training Llama 3 405B on its own generated data is not helpful (and can even degrade performance). To address this limitation, we introduced execution feedback as a source of truth, enabling the model to learn from its mistakes and stay on track. In particular, we generate large dataset of approximately one million synthetic coding dialogues using the following process:
	- Problem description generation: First, we generate a large collection of programming problem descriptions that span a diverse range of topics, including those in the long tail distribution. To achieve this diversity, we sample random code snippets from various sources and prompt the model to generate programming problems inspired by these examples. This allowed us to tap into a wide range of topics and create a comprehensive set of problem descriptions (Wei et al., 2024).
	- Solution generation: Then, we prompt Llama 3 to solve each problem in a given programming language. We observe that adding general rules of good programming to the prompt improves the generated solution quality. Also, we find it is helpful to require the model to explain its thought process in comments.
	- Correctness analysis: After generating a solution, it is crucial to recognize that its correctness is not guaranteed, and including incorrect solutions in the finetuning dataset could harm the model's quality. While we do not ensure complete correctness, we develop methods to approximate it. To achieve this, we extract the source code from the generated solution and applied a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques to test its correctness, including:
		- Static analysis: We run all generated code through a parser and a linter to ensure syntactic correctness, catching errors such as syntax errors, use of uninitialized variables or non-imported functions, code style issues, typing errors, and others.
		- Unit test generation and execution: For each problem and solution, we prompt the model to generate unit tests, executed in a containerized environment together with the solution, catching run-time execution errors and some semantic errors.
	- Error feedback and iterative self-correction: When a solution fails at any step, we prompt the model to revise it. The prompt included the original problem description, the faulty solution, and feedback from the parser/linter/tester (stdout, stderr/ and return code). After a unit test execution failure, the model could either fix the code to pass the existing tests or modify its unit tests to accommodate the generated code. Only dialogs that pass all checks are included in the final dataset, used for supervised finetuning (SFT). Notably, we observed that about 20% of solutions were initially incorrect but self-corrected, indicating that the model learned from the execution feedback and improved its performance.
	- Fine-tuning and iterative improvement: The finetuning process is conducted over multiple rounds, with each round building on the previous one. After each round, the model is improved, generating higher-quality synthetic data for the next round. This iterative process allows for progressive refinement and enhancement of the model's performance.
- 2. Synthetic data generation: programming language translation. We observe a performance gap between major programming languages (e.g., Python/C++) and less common ones (e.g., Typescript/PHP). This is not surprising as we have less training data for less common programming languages. To mitigate this, we supplement our existing data by translating data from common programming languages to less common languages (similar to Chen et al. (2023) in the context of reasoning). This is achieved by prompting Llama 3 and ensuring quality via syntax parsing, compilation, and execution. Figure 8 demonstrates an example of synthetic PHP code translated from Python. This improves performance significantly for less common languages as measured by the MultiPL-E (Cassano et al., 2023) benchmark.
- 3. Synthetic data generation: backtranslation. To improve certain coding capabilities (e.g., documentation, explanations) where execution feedback is less informative for determining quality, we employ an alternative multi-step approach. Using this procedure, we generated approximately 1.2M synthetic

Figure 8 Code translation example. We display an example of using Llama 3 to translate Python code (left) to PHP code (right) to augment our SFT dataset with a wider range of programming languages.

dialogs related to code explanation, generation, documentation, and debugging. Beginning with code snippets from a variety of languages in our pre-training data:

- Generate: We prompt Llama 3 to generate data that represents our target capability (e.g., we add comments and docstrings for the code snippet, or we ask the model to explain a piece of code).
- Backtranslate: We then prompt the model to "backtranslate" the synthetically generated data to the original code (e.g., we prompt the model to generate code only from its documentation, or we ask the model to generate code only from its explanation).
- Filter: Using the original code as a reference, we prompt the Llama 3 to determine the quality of the output (e.g., we ask the model how faithful the backtranslated code is to the original). We then use the generated examples that have the highest self-verification scores in SFT.

System prompt steering during rejection sampling. During the rejection sampling process, we used code specific system prompts to improve code readability, documentation, thoroughness, and specificity. Recall, from Section 7 this data is used to finetune the language model. Figure 9 shows an example of how the system prompt helps improve the generated code quality — it adds necessary comments, uses more informative variable names, saves memory, etc.

Filtering training data with execution and model-as-judge signals. As described in Section 4.2.3, we occasionally encounter quality issues in our rejection-sampled data, such as code blocks containing bugs. Detecting these issues in our rejection-sampled data is not as straightforward as it is for our synthetic code data, as the rejection-sampled responses typically contain a mix of natural language and code for which the code may not always be expected to be executable. (For example, user prompts may explicitly ask for pseudo-code or edits to only a very small snippet of an executable program.) To address this, we utilize the "model-as-judge" approach, where earlier versions of Llama 3 assess and assign a binary (0/1) score based on two criteria: code correctness and code style. We retain only those samples that achieve a perfect score of 2. Initially, this stringent filtering led to a regression in downstream benchmark performance, primarily because it disproportionately removed examples with challenging prompts. To counteract this, we strategically revise the responses of some coding data categorized as most challenging until they met the Llama-based "model-as-judge" criteria. By refining these challenging problems, the coding data achieves a balance between quality and difficulty, resulting in optimal downstream performance.

#### 4.3.2 Multilinguality

We describe how we improve Llama 3's multilingual capabilities, including training an expert specialized on substantially more multilingual data, sourcing and generating high quality multilingual instruction tuning data for German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai, and tackling specific challenges of multilingual language steering to enhance the overall performance of our model.

Expert training. Our Llama 3 pre-training data mix contains significantly more English tokens than non-English tokens. To collect higher quality human annotations in non-English languages, we train a multilingual expert by branching off the pre-training run and continuing to pre-train on a data mix that consists of 90% multilingual tokens. We then perform post-training on this expert following Section 4.1. This expert model is then used to collect higher quality annotations in non-English languages until pre-training was fully complete.

Multilingual data collection. Our multilingual SFT data is derived primarily from sources described below. The overall distribution is 2.4% human annotations, 44.2% data from other NLP tasks, 18.8% rejection sampled data, and 34.6% translated reasoning data.

- Human annotations: We collect high-quality, manually annotated data from linguists and native speakers. These annotations mostly consist of open-ended prompts that represent real world use cases.
- Data from other NLP tasks: To further augment, we use multilingual training data from other tasks and rewrite into dialog format. For example, we use data from exams-qa (Hardalov et al., 2020) and Conic10k (Wu et al., 2023). To improve language alignment, we also use parallel texts from GlobalVoices (Prokopidis et al., 2016) and Wikimedia (Tiedemann, 2012). We use LID based filtering and Blaser2.0 (Seamless Communication et al., 2023) to remove low quality data. For parallel text data, instead of using the bitext pairs directly, we apply a multilingual template inspired by Wei et al. (2022a) to better simulate real-life conversations in translation and language learning scenarios.
- Rejection sampled data: We apply rejection sampling on our human annotated prompts to generate high-quality samples for finetuning, with few modifications compared to the process for English data:
	- Generation: We explored randomly choosing the temperature hyperparameter from the range 0.2 − 1 for diverse generations in early rounds of post-training. With high temperature, responses for multilingual prompts can get creative and inspiring, but are also susceptible to unnecessary or unnatural code-switching. In the final round of post-training, we use a constant value of 0.6 to balance the trade-off. Additionally, we used specialized system prompts to improve response format, structure and general readability.
	- Selection: Prior to reward model based selection, we implement multilingual-specific checks to ensure high language-match rate between the prompt and response (e.g., a romanized Hindi prompt should not expect a response in Hindi Devanagari script).
- Translated data: We try to avoid using machine-translated data to finetune the model in order to prevent translationese (Bizzoni et al., 2020; Muennighoff et al., 2023) or possible name bias (Wang et al., 2022a), gender bias (Savoldi et al., 2021), or cultural bias (Ji et al., 2023). Moreover, we aim to prevent the model from being exposed only to tasks that are rooted in English cultural context, which may not be representative of the linguistic and cultural diversity we aim to capture. We made one exception to this and translated our synthetic quantitative reasoning data (see Section 4.3.3 for details) to improve performance in quantitative reasoning in non-English languages. Due to the simple nature of

the language in these math problems, the translated samples were found to have little to no quality issues. We observed strong gains on MGSM (Shi et al., 2022) from adding this translated data.

#### 4.3.3 Math and Reasoning

We define reasoning as the ability to perform multi-step computations and arrive at the correct final answer. Several challenges guide our approach to training models that excel in mathematical reasoning:

- Lack of prompts: As the complexity of questions increases, the number of valid prompts or questions for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) decreases. This scarcity makes it difficult to create diverse and representative training datasets for teaching models various mathematical skills (Yu et al., 2023; Yue et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023; Mitra et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024; Yue et al., 2024b).
- Lack of ground truth chain of thought: Effective reasoning requires a step-by-step solution to facilitate the reasoning process (Wei et al., 2022c). However, there is often a shortage of ground truth chains of thought, which are essential for guiding the model how to break down the problem step-by-step and reach the final answer (Zelikman et al., 2022).
- Incorrect intermediate steps: When using model-generated chains of thought, the intermediate steps may not always be correct (Cobbe et al., 2021; Uesato et al., 2022; Lightman et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a). This inaccuracy can lead to incorrect final answers and needs to be addressed.
- Teaching models to use external tools: Enhancing models to utilize external tools, such as code interpreters, allows them to reason by interleaving code and text (Gao et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2022; Gou et al., 2023). This capability can significantly improve their problem-solving abilities.
- Discrepancy between training and inference: There is often a discrepancy between how the model is finetuned during training and how it is used during inference. During inference, the finetuned model may interact with humans or other models, requiring it to improve its reasoning using feedback. Ensuring consistency between training and real-world usage is crucial for maintaining reasoning performance.

To address these challenges, we apply the following methodologies:

- Addressing the lack of prompts: We source relevant pre-training data from mathematical contexts and converted it into a question-answer format which can then be used for supervised finetuning. Additionally, we identify mathematical skills where the model under-performs and actively sourced prompts from humans to teach models such skills. To facilitate this process, we create a taxonomy of mathematical skills (Didolkar et al., 2024) and ask humans to provide relevant prompts/questions accordingly.
- Augmenting training data with step-wise reasoning traces: We use Llama 3 to generate step-by-step solutions for a set of prompts. For each prompt, the model produces a variable number of generations. These generations are then filtered based on the correct answer (Li et al., 2024a). We also do selfverification where Llama 3 is used to verify whether a particular step-by-step solution is valid for a given question. This process improves the quality of the finetuning data by eliminating instances where the model does not produce valid reasoning traces.
- Filtering incorrect reasoning traces: We train outcome and stepwise reward models (Lightman et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a) to filter training data where the intermediate reasoning steps were incorrect. These reward models are used to eliminate data with invalid step-by-step reasoning, ensuring high-quality data for finetuning. For more challenging prompts, we use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with learned step-wise reward models to generate valid reasoning traces, further enhancing the collection of high-quality reasoning data (Xie et al., 2024).
- Interleaving code and text reasoning: We prompt Llama 3 to solve reasoning problems through a combination of textual reasoning and associated Python code (Gou et al., 2023). Code execution is used as a feedback signal to eliminate cases where the reasoning chain was not valid, ensuring the correctness of the reasoning process.
- Learning from feedback and mistakes: To simulate human feedback, we utilize incorrect generations (i.e., generations leading to incorrect reasoning traces) and perform error correction by prompting Llama 3 to

yield correct generations (An et al., 2023b; Welleck et al., 2022; Madaan et al., 2024a). The iterative process of using feedback from incorrect attempts and correcting them helps improve the model's ability to reason accurately and learn from its mistakes.

#### 4.3.4 Long Context

During the final pre-training stage, we extend the context length of Llama 3 from 8K tokens to 128K tokens (see Section 3.4 for more details). Similar to pre-training, we find that during finetuning we must carefully tune the recipe to balance short and long-context capabilities.

SFT and synthetic data generation. Naively applying our existing SFT recipe with only short-context data resulted in significant regressions in long-context capabilities from pre-training, highlighting the need to incorporate long-context data in our SFT data mix. In practice, however, it is largely impractical to get humans to annotate such examples due to the tedious and time-consuming nature of reading lengthy contexts, so we predominantly rely on synthetic data to fill this gap. We use earlier versions of Llama 3 to generate synthetic data based on the key long-context use-cases: (possibly multi-turn) question-answering, summarization for long documents, and reasoning over code repositories, and describe them in greater detail below.

- Question answering: We carefully curate a set of long documents from our pre-training mix. We split these documents into chunks of 8K tokens, and prompted an earlier version of the Llama 3 model to generate QA pairs conditional on randomly selected chunks. During training, the whole document is used as context.
- Summarization: We applied hierarchical summarization of long-context documents by first summarizing the chunks of 8K input length using our strongest Llama 3 8K context model and then summarizing the summaries. During training we provide the full document and prompt the model to summarize the document while preserving all the important details. We also generate QA pairs based on the summaries of the documents and prompt the model with questions that require global understanding of the whole long document.
- Long context code reasoning: We parse Python files to identify import statements and determine their dependencies. From here, we select the most commonly depended-upon files, specifically those referenced by at least five other files. We remove one of these key files from a repository and prompt the model to identify which files depended on the missing file and to generate the necessary missing code.

We further categorize these synthetically generated samples based on the sequence length (16K, 32K, 64K and 128K) to enable more fine-grained targeting of input lengths.

Through careful ablations, we observe that mixing 0.1% of synthetically generated long-context data with the original short-context data optimizes the performance across both short-context and long-context benchmarks.

DPO. We observe that using only short context training data in DPO did not negatively impact long-context performance as long as the SFT model is high quality in long context tasks. We suspect this is due to the fact that our DPO recipe has fewer optimizer steps than SFT. Given this finding, we keep the standard short-context recipe for DPO on top of our long-context SFT checkpoints.

#### 4.3.5 Tool Use

Teaching LLMs to use tools such as search engines or code interpreters hugely expands the range of tasks they can solve, transforming them from pure chat models into more general assistants (Nakano et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Parisi et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023; Mialon et al., 2023a; Schick et al., 2024). We train Llama 3 to interact with the following tools:

- Search engine. Llama 3 is trained to use Brave Search7 to answer questions about recent events that go beyond its knowledge cutoff or that require retrieving a particular piece of information from the web.
- Python interpreter. Llama 3 can generate and execute code to perform complex computations, read files uploaded by the user and solve tasks based on them such as question answering, summarization, data analysis or visualization.

<sup>7</sup>https://brave.com/search/api/

- Mathematical computational engine. Llama 3 can use the Wolfram Alpha API8 to more accurately solve math, science problems, or retrieve accurate information from Wolfram's database.
The resulting model is able to use these tools in a chat setup to solve the user's queries, including in multi-turn dialogs. If a query requires multiple tool calls, the model can write a step-by-step plan, call the tools in sequence, and do reasoning after each tool call.

We also improve Llama 3's zero-shot tool use capabilities — given in-context, potentially unseen tool definitions and a user query, we train the model to generate the correct tool call.

Implementation. We implement our core tools as Python objects with different methods. Zero-shot tools can be implemented as Python functions with descriptions, documentation (i.e., examples for how to use them), and the model only needs the function's signature and docstring as context to generate the appropriate call. We also convert function definitions and calls to JSON format, e.g., for web API calls. All tool calls are executed by the Python interpreter, that must be enabled in the Llama 3 system prompt. Core tools can be individually enabled or disabled in the system prompt.

Data collection. Different from Schick et al. (2024), we rely on human annotations and preferences to teach Llama 3 to use tools. There are two main differences with the post-training pipeline generally used in Llama 3:

- For tools, dialogs often contain more than a single assistant message (e.g., calling the tool and reasoning about the tool output). Thus, we annotate at the message level to collect granular feedback: annotators provide a preference between two assistant messages with the same context or, if both contain major problems, edit one of the messages. The chosen or edited message is then added to the context and the dialog continues. This provides human feedback for both the assistant's ability of calling the tools and reasoning about the tool outputs. Annotators cannot rank or edit the tool outputs.
- We do not perform rejection sampling, as we did not observe gains in our tool benchmarks.

To accelerate the annotation process, we start by bootstrapping basic tool use capabilities by finetuning on synthetically generated data from previous Llama 3 checkpoints. Thus, annotators have fewer edits to perform. In a similar spirit, as Llama 3 gradually improves through its development, we progressively complexify our human annotation protocols: we start by single-turn tool use annotations, before moving to tool use in dialogs, and finally annotating for multi-step tool use and data analysis.

Tool datasets. To create data for tool usage applications, we leverage the following procedure:

- Single-step tool use: We start by few-shot generation of synthetic user prompts which, by construction, require a call to one of our core tools (for example, questions that exceed our knowledge cutoff date). Then, still relying on few-shot generation, we generate appropriate tool calls for these prompts, execute them, and add the output to the model's context. Finally, we prompt the model again to generate a final answer to the user's query based on the tool output. We end up with trajectories of the following form: system prompt, user prompt, tool call, tool output, final answer. We also filter around 30% this dataset to remove tool calls that cannot be executed or other formatting issues.
- Multi-step tool use: We follow a similar protocol and first generate synthetic data to teach the model basic multi-step tool use capabilities. To do this, we first prompt Llama 3 to generate user prompts that require at least two tool calls, that can be the same or different tools from our core set. Then, conditioned on these prompts, we few-shot prompt Llama 3 to generate a solution consisting of interleaved reasoning steps and tool calls, similar to ReAct (Yao et al., 2022). See Figure 10 for an example of Llama 3 performing a task involving multi-step tool usage.
- File uploads: We annotate for the following filetypes: .txt, .docx, .pdf, .pptx, .xlsx, .csv, .tsv, .py, .json, .jsonl, .html, .xml. Our prompts are based on a provided file, and ask to summarize the contents of the file, find and fix bugs, optimize a piece of code, perform data analysis or visualization. See Figure 11 for an example of Llama 3 performing a task involving a file upload.

After finetuning on this synthetic data, we gather human annotations in diverse and challenging scenarios including multi-turn interactions, more than three step tool use, and instances where a tool call does not yield

a satisfying answer. We augment our synthetic data with different system prompts to teach the model to use tools only when activated. To train the model to avoid calling tools for simple queries, we also add queries from easy math or question answering datasets (Berant et al., 2013; Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016; Joshi et al., 2017; Amini et al., 2019) and their responses without tools, but with tools activated in system prompt.

Zero-shot tool use data. We improve Llama 3 zero-shot tool use abilities (also referred to as function calling) by finetuning on a large and diverse set of partly synthetic (functions definitions, user query, corresponding call) tuples. We evaluate our model on a set of unseen tools.

- Single, nested, and parallel function calling: Calls can be simple, nested, i.e. we pass a function call as an argument of another function, or parallel, i.e. the model returns a list of independent function calls. Generating a diverse set of functions, queries and ground truths can be challenging (Mekala et al., 2024), and we resort to mining the Stack (Kocetkov et al., 2022) to ground our synthetic user queries in real functions. More precisely, we extract function calls and their definitions, clean and filter them, e.g. for missing docstrings or non-executable functions, and use Llama 3 to generate a natural language query corresponding to the function call.
- Multi-turn function calling: We also generate synthetic data for multi-turn dialogs with function calls, following a protocol similar to the one proposed in Li et al. (2023b). We use multiple agents that generate domains, APIs, user queries, API calls, and responses, while also ensuring that the generated data covers a set of diverse domains and realistic APIs. All agents are variants of Llama 3 prompted in different ways depending on their roles and collaborate in a step-by-step manner.

#### 4.3.6 Factuality

Hallucinations remain a major challenge for large language models. Models tend to be overconfident, even in domains where they have little knowledge. Despite these shortcomings, they are often used as knowledge bases, which can lead to risky outcomes such as the spread of misinformation. While we recognize that factuality can go beyond hallucinations, we took a hallucination-first approach here.

We follow the principle that post-training should align the model to "know what it knows" rather than add knowledge (Gekhman et al., 2024; Mielke et al., 2020). Our primary approach involves generating data that aligns model generations with subsets of factual data present in the pre-training data. To achieve this, we develop a knowledge probing technique that takes advantage of Llama 3's in-context abilities. This data generation process involves the following procedure:

- 1. Extract a data snippet from the pre-training data.
- 2. Generate a factual question about these snippets (context) by prompting Llama 3.
- 3. Sample responses from Llama 3 to the question.
- 4. Score the correctness of the generations using the original context as a reference and Llama 3 as a judge.
- 5. Score the informativeness of the generations using Llama 3 as a judge.
- 6. Generate a refusal for responses which are consistently informative and incorrect across the generations, using Llama 3.

We use data generated from the knowledge probe to encourage the model to only answer questions which it has knowledge about, and refuse answering those questions that it is unsure about. Further, pre-training data is not always factually consistent or correct. We therefore also collect a limited set of labeled factuality data that deals with sensitive topics where factually contradictory or incorrect statements are prevalent.

#### 4.3.7 Steerability

Steerability is the ability to direct the model's actions and outcomes to meet developer and user specifications. As Llama 3 is a generic foundational model, it should be maximally steerable to different downstream use cases easily. For Llama 3, we focus on enhancing its steerability through system prompt with natural language instructions, especially around response length, format, tone and character/persona.

Data collection. We collect steerability preference samples within the general English category by asking annotators to design different system prompts for Llama 3. Annotators then engage in conversations with the models to evaluate their consistency in following instructions defined in system prompts over the course of the conversation. We show an example customized system prompt used for enhancing steerability below:

You are a helpful and cheerful AI Chatbot that acts as a meal plan assistant for busy families. The family consists of 2 adults, 3 teenagers, and 2 preschoolers. Plan two or three days at a time and use leftovers or extra ingredients for the second day's plan. The user will let you know if they want two or three days. If they don't, assume three days. Each plan should include breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner. Ask the user if they approve of the plan or need adjustments. After they approve provide a grocery list with family size in mind. Always keep family preferences in mind and if there's something that they don't like provide a substitution. If the user is not feeling inspired then ask them what's the one place they wish they could visit on vacation this week and then suggest meals based on that location's culture. Weekend meals can be more complex. Weekday meals should be quick and easy. For breakfast and lunch, easy food like cereal, English muffins with pre-cooked bacon, and other quick easy foods are preferred. The family is busy. Be sure to ask if they have essentials and favorites on hand like coffee or energy drinks so they don't forget to buy it. Remember to be budget-conscious unless it's a special occasion.

Modeling. After we collect the preference data, we leverage this data in reward modeling, rejection sampling, SFT, and DPO to enhance Llama 3's steerability.

### 5 Results

We performed an extensive series of evaluations of Llama 3, investigating the performance of: (1) the pre-trained language model, (2) the post-trained language model, and (3) the safety characteristics of Llama 3. We present the results of these evaluations in separate subsections below.

### 5.1 Pre-trained Language Model

In this section, we report evaluation results for our pre-trained Llama 3 (Section 3), comparing with various other models of comparable sizes. We reproduce results of competitor models whenever possible. For non-Llama models, we report the best score across results that are publicly reported or (where possible) that we reproduced ourselves. The specifics of these evaluations, including configurations such as the number of shots, metrics, and other pertinent hyperparameters and settings, can be accessed on our Github repository here. Additionally, we are releasing the data generated as part of evaluations with publicly available benchmarks which can be found on Huggingface here. We evaluate the quality of our models on standard benchmarks (Section 5.1.1), for robustness to changes in multiple-choice question setups (Section 5.1.2), and on adversarial evaluations (Section 5.1.3). We also conduct a contamination analysis to estimate the extent to which our evaluations are impacted by contamination of training data (Section 5.1.4).

#### 5.1.1 Standard Benchmarks

To compare our models with the current state-of-the-art, we evaluate Llama 3 on a large number of standard benchmark evaluations shown in Table 8. These evaluations cover eight top-level categories: (1) commonsense reasoning; (2) knowledge; (3) reading comprehension; (4) math, reasoning, and problem solving; (5) long context; (6) code; (7) adversarial evaluations; and (8) aggregate evaluations.

Table 8 Pre-training benchmarks by category. Overview of all benchmarks we use to evaluate pre-trained Llama 3 models, grouped by capability category.

Experimental setup. For each benchmark, we compute scores for Llama 3 as well as various other pre-trained models of comparable sizes. Where possible, we recompute numbers with our own pipeline for other models. To ensure a fair comparison, we then select the best score between the score that we computed and the reported number for that model with comparable or more conservative settings. You can find additional details on our evaluation setup here. For some models, it is not possible to (re)compute benchmark values, for instance, because the pre-trained model is not released or because the API does not provide access to log-probabilities. In particular, this is true for all models comparable to Llama 3 405B. Thus, we do not report category averages for Llama 3 405B, which requires that all numbers are available for all benchmarks.

Significance estimates. Benchmark scores are estimates of a model's true performance. These estimates have variance because benchmark sets are finite samples drawn from some underlying distribution. We follow Madaan et al. (2024b) and report on this variance via 95% confidence intervals (CIs), assuming that benchmark scores are Gaussian distributed. While this assumption is incorrect (e.g., benchmark scores are bounded), preliminary bootstrap experiments suggest CIs (for discrete metrics) are a good approximation:

$$C I(S)=1.96\times{\sqrt{\frac{S\times(1-S)}{N}}}.$$

Herein, S is the observed benchmark score (e.g., accuracy or EM) and N the sample size of the benchmark. We omit CIs for benchmark scores that are not simple averages. We note that because subsampling is not the only source of variation, our CI values lower bound the actual variation in the capability estimate.

Results for 8B and 70B models. Figure 12 reports the average performance of Llama 3 8B and 70B on the commonsense reasoning, knowledge, reading comprehension, math and reasoning, and code benchmarks. The results show that Llama 3 8B outperforms competing models in virtually every category, both in terms of per-category win rate and in terms of average per-category performance. We also find that Llama 3 70B outperforms its predecessor Llama 2 70B by a large margin on most benchmarks, with the exception of commonsense benchmarks that are likely saturated. Llama 3 70B also outperforms Mixtral 8x22B.

Detailed results for all models. Table 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 present the benchmark performance of pre-trained Llama 3 8B, 70B, and 405B models on reading comprehension tasks, coding tasks, commonsense understanding tasks, mathematical reasoning tasks, and general tasks. The tables compare Llama 3's performance with that

of models of similar size. The results show that Llama 3 405B performs competitively with other models in its class. In particular, Llama 3 405B substantially outperforms prior open-source models. For long-context, we present more comprehensive results (including probing tasks like needle-in-a-haystack) in Section 5.2.

#### 5.1.2 Model Robustness

In addition to performance on benchmarks, robustness is an important factor in the quality of pre-trained language models. We investigate the robustness of our pre-trained language models to design choices in multiple-choice question (MCQ) setups. Prior work has reported that model performance can be sensitive to seemingly arbitrary design choices in such setups, for example, model scores and even rankings may change with the order and labels of the in-context examples (Lu et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2021; Robinson and Wingate, 2023; Liang et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2024), the exact format of the prompt (Weber et al., 2023b; Mishra et al., 2022), or the answer choice format and order (Alzahrani et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a; Zheng et al., 2023). Motivated by this work, we use the MMLU benchmark to evaluate the robustness of our pre-trained models to: (1) few-shot label bias, (2) label variants, (3) answer order, and (4) prompt format:

- Few-shot label bias. Following Zheng et al. (2023) and Weber et al. (2023a), we investigate the impact of the distribution of labels in four-shot examples. Specifically, we consider settings in which: (1) all

few-shot examples have the same label (A A A A); (2) all examples have a different label (A B C D); and (3) there are only two labels present (A A B B and C C D D).

- Label variants. We also study model response to different choice token sets. We consider the two sets proposed by Alzahrani et al. (2024): namely, a set of common language independent tokens ($ & # @) and a of rare tokens (œ § з ü) that do not have any implicit relative order. We also consider two versions of the canonical labels (A. B. C. D. and A) B) C) D)) and a numerical list (1. 2. 3. 4.).
- Answer order. Following Wang et al. (2024a), we compute how stable the results are across different answer orders. To compute this, we remap all the answers in the dataset according to a fixed permutation. For example, for the permutation A B C D, all answer options with label A and B keep their label, and all answer options with label C get label D, and vice versa.
- Prompt format. We evaluate variance in performance across five task prompts that differ in the level of information provided: one prompt simply asks the model to answer the question, whereas other prompts assert the expertise of the model or that the best answer should be chosen.

Figure 13 presents the results of our experiments studying robustness of model performance to label variants (left) and few-shot label bias (right). The results show that our pre-trained language models are very robust to changes in MCQ labels and to the structure of the few-shot prompt labels. This robustness is particularly

pronounced for the 405B parameter model. Figure 14 presents the results of our study of robustness to answer order and prompt format. The results in the figure further underscore the robustness of the performance of our pre-trained language models, in particular, of Llama 3 405B.

#### 5.1.3 Adversarial Benchmarks

In addition to the benchmarks presented above, we evaluate on several adversarial benchmarks in three areas: question answering, mathematical reasoning, and paraphrase detection. This testing probes the model's capabilities on tasks specifically created to be challenging and can potentially also point to overfitting on benchmarks. For question answering, we use Adversarial SQuAD (Jia and Liang, 2017) and Dynabench SQuAD (Kiela et al., 2021). For mathematical reasoning, we use GSM-Plus (Li et al., 2024c). For paraphrase detection, we use PAWS (Zhang et al., 2019).

Figure 15 presents the scores of Llama 3 8B, 70B, and 405B on the adversarial benchmarks as a function of their performance on non-adversarial benchmarks. The non-adversarial benchmarks we use are SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) for question answering, GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and QQP (Wang et al., 2017) for paraphrase detection. Each datapoint represents a pair of an adversarial and non-adversarial datasets (e.g. QQP paired with PAWS), and we show all possible pairs within a category. The diagonal black line represents parity between adversarial and non-adversarial datasets — being on the line would indicate the model has similar performance regardless of the adversarial nature.

On paraphrase detection, neither pre-trained nor post-trained models appear to suffer from the type of adversariality with which PAWS was constructed, marking a substantial step with respect to the previous generation of models. This result confirms the findings of Weber et al. (2023a), who also found that LLMs are less susceptible to the type of spurious correlations found in several adversarial datasets. For mathematical reasoning and question answering, however, the adversarial performances are substantially lower than the non-adversarial performances. This pattern is similar for pre-trained and post-trained models.

#### 5.1.4 Contamination Analysis

We conduct a contamination analysis to estimate to what extent benchmark scores may be influenced by contamination of the evaluation data in the pre-training corpus. In previous work, several different contamination methods have been used, with various different hyperparameters – we refer to Singh et al. (2024) for an overview. Any of these methods can suffer from false positives and negatives, and how to best run contamination analyses is currently still an open field of research. Here, we largely follow the suggestions of Singh et al. (2024).

Method. Specifically, Singh et al. (2024) propose to select contamination detection methods empirically, based on which method results in the largest difference between the 'clean' part of the dataset and the entire dataset, which they call estimated performance gain. For all our evaluation datasets, we score examples based on 8-gram overlap, a method that was found by Singh et al. (2024) to be accurate for many datasets. We consider an example of a dataset D to be contaminated if a ratio TD of its tokens are part of an 8-gram occurring at least once in the pre-training corpus. We select TD separately for each dataset, based on which value shows the maximal significant estimated performance gain across the three model sizes.

Results. In Table 15, we report the percentage of evaluation data that is considered contaminated for the maximal estimated performance gain, as described above, for all key benchmarks. From the table, we exclude numbers for benchmarks for which the results are not significant, for instance because the clean or contaminated set has too few examples, or because the observed performance gain estimate shows extremely erratic behavior. In Table 15, we observe that for some datasets contamination has a large impact, while for others it does not. For example, for PiQA and HellaSwag, both the estimation of contamination and the estimation of performance gain are high. For Natural Questions, on the other hand, the estimated 52% contamination seems to have virtually no effect on the performance. For SQuAD and MATH, low thresholds yield high levels of contamination, but no performance gains. This suggests that contamination is either not helpful for these datasets, or that a larger n is required to obtain a better estimate. Finally, for MBPP, HumanEval, MMLU

and MMLU-Pro, other contamination detection methods may be needed: even with higher thresholds, 8-gram overlap gives such high contamination scores that it is impossible to get a good performance gain estimate.

#### 5.2 Post-trained Language Model

We present results for our Llama 3 post-trained models on benchmarks across different capabilities. Similar to pre-training we are releasing the data generated as part of evaluations with publicly available benchmarks which can be found on Huggingface here. Additional details on our eval setup can be found here.

Benchmarks and metrics. Table 16 contains an overview of all the benchmarks, organized by the capability. We apply decontamination of the post-training data by running exact match with the prompts from each benchmark. In addition to the standard academic benchmarks, we also performed extensive human evaluation of different capabilities. Details are provided in Section 5.3.

Experimental setup. We employ a similar experimental setup to the pre-training phase and conduct a comparative analysis of Llama 3 alongside other models of comparable size and capability. To the extent possible, we evaluate the performance of other models ourselves and compare the results with the reported numbers, selecting the best score. You can find additional details on our evaluation setup here.

#### 5.2.1 General Knowledge and Instruction-Following Benchmarks

We evaluate Llama 3 on benchmarks for general knowledge and instruction-following in Table 2.

General knowledge. We leverage MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024b) to evaluate Llama 3's capability on knowledge-based question answering. For MMLU, we report the macro average of subtask accuracy under the 5-shot standard setting without CoT. MMLU-Pro is an extension of MMLU, incorporating more challenging, reasoning-focused questions, eliminating noisy questions, and expanding the choice set from four to ten options. Given its focus on complex reasoning, we report 5-shot CoT for MMLU-Pro. All tasks are formatted as generation tasks, similar to simple-evals (OpenAI, 2024).

As shown in Table 2, our 8B and 70B Llama 3 variants outperform other models of similar sizes on both general knowledge tasks. Our 405B model outperforms GPT-4 and Nemotron 4 340B, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet leading among larger models.

Instruction following. We assess the ability of Llama 3 and other models to follow natural language instructions on IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023). IFEval comprises approximately 500 "verifiable instructions" such as "write in more than 400 words", which can be verified by heuristics. We report the average of prompt-level and instruction-level accuracy, under strict and loose constraints in Table 2. Note that all Llama 3 variants outperform comparable models across IFEval.

#### 5.2.2 Proficiency Exams

Next, we evaluate our models on a wide variety of proficiency exams originally designed to test humans. We source these exams from publicly available official sources; for some exams, we report average scores across different exam sets per proficiency exam. Specifically, we average:

- GRE: Official GRE Practice Test 1 and 2 (from the Educational Testing Services);
- LSAT: Official Preptest 71, 73, 80 and 93;
- SAT: 8 exams from The Official SAT Study guide edition 2018;
- AP: One official practice exam per subject;
- GMAT Official GMAT Online Exam.

Questions in these exams contain both MCQ style and generation questions. We exclude the questions that are accompanied with images. For the GRE exams that contain questions with multiple correct options, we qualify the outputs as correct only if all the correct options are selected by the model. The evaluations are

Table 17 Performance of Llama 3 models and GPT-4o on a variety of proficiency exams including LSAT, SAT, GMAT, and AP, and GRE tests. For GRE exams, we report normalized score; for all others, we report accuracy. For the bottom two rows corresponding to GRE Quant. and GRE Verbal, we report the scaled scores out of 170.

run using few shot prompting wherever we have more than 1 exam set per exam. We scale the scores to be in the range 130-170 for GRE and report accuracy for all other exams.

Our results can be found in Table 17. We observe that the performance of our Llama 3 405B model is very similar to Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4 4o. Our 70B model has an even more impressive performance. It is significantly better than GPT-3.5 Turbo and beats Nemotron 4 340B on many tests.

#### 5.2.3 Coding Benchmarks

We evaluate Llama 3 on code generation on several popular Python and multi-programming language benchmarks. To gauge the effectiveness of our models in generating functionally correct code, we use the pass@N metric, which evaluates the pass rate for a set of unit tests among N generations. We report pass@1.

Python code generation. HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) are popular benchmarks for Python code generation which focus on relatively simple, self-contained functions. HumanEval+ (Liu et al., 2024a) is an enhanced version of HumanEval, in which more tests are generated to avoid false positives. The MBPP EvalPlus base version (v0.2.0) is a selection of 378 well-formed problems out of the 974 initial problems in all of the original MBPP (train and test) dataset (Liu et al., 2024a). Results for these benchmarks are reported in Table 18. Across the Python variants of these benchmarks, Llama 3 8B and 70B outperform

models of similar sizes. For the largest models, Llama 3 405B, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o perform similarly, with GPT-4o showing the strongest results.

Multi-programming language code generation. To assess code generation capabilities beyond Python, we report results for the MultiPL-E (Cassano et al., 2023) benchmark, which is based on translations of problems from HumanEval and MBPP. Results for a subset of popular programming languages are reported in Table 19. Note that there is a significant drop in performance compared to the Python counterparts in Table 18.

#### 5.2.4 Multilingual Benchmarks

Llama 3 supports 8 languages — English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai, although the underlying foundation model has been trained on a broader collection of languages.9 In Table 20, we show results from evaluating Llama 3 on the multilingual MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) and Multilingual Grade School Math (MGSM) (Shi et al., 2022) benchmarks.

Multilingual MMLU. We translate MMLU questions, few-shot examples, and answers using Google Translate. We leave the task instructions in English and perform the evaluation in a 5-shot setting. In Table 20, we report average results across German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai.

<sup>9</sup>Llama 3 has not been optimized or safety tuned for use cases in those other languages. Developers may fine-tune Llama 3 models for languages beyond the 8 supported languages provided they comply with the Llama 3 Community License and the Acceptable Use Policy and in such cases are responsible for ensuring that any uses of Llama 3 in additional languages is done in a safe and responsible manner.

MGSM (Shi et al., 2022). We use the same native prompts as in simple-evals (OpenAI, 2024) for testing our models in a 0-shot CoT setting. In Table 20, we report averge results across languages covered in MGSM benchmark.

We find that Llama 3 405B outperforms most other models on MGSM, achieving an average of 91.6%. On MMLU, in line with English MMLU results shown above, Llama 3 405B falls behind GPT-4o by 2%. On the other hand, both Llama 3 70B and 8B models demonstrate strong performance, leading among competitors with a wide margin on both tasks.

#### 5.2.5 Math and Reasoning Benchmarks

Our math and reasoning benchmark results are presented in Table 2. Llama 3 8B model outperforms other models of similar sizes on GSM8K, MATH, and GPQA. Our 70B model performs significantly better than other models in its class on all the benchmarks. Finally, Llama 3 405B model is the best in its category

Table 20 Multilingual benchmarks. For MGSM (Shi et al., 2022), we report 0-shot CoT results for our Llama 3 models. Multilingual MMLU is an internal benchmark with translated MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) questions and answers into 7 languages – we report 5-shot results averaged across these languages.

on GSM8K and ARC-C, while on MATH, it is the second best model. On GPQA, it is competitive with GPT-4 4o, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet being the best model by a significant margin.

#### 5.2.6 Long Context Benchmarks

We consider a diverse set of tasks that span various domains and text types. In the benchmarks we list below, we focus on sub-tasks that use unbiased evaluation protocols, i.e., accuracy-based metrics rather than n-gram overlapping metrics. We also prioritize tasks that we found to be of low variance.

- Needle-in-a-Haystack (Kamradt, 2023) measures a model's ability to retrieve a hidden information inserted in random parts of the long document. Our Llama 3 models demonstrate perfect needle retrieval performance, successfully retrieving 100% of needles at all document depths and context lengths. We also measure performance on Multi-needle (Table 21), a variation of Needle-in-a-Haystack, where we insert four needles in the context and test if a model can retrieve two of them. Our Llama 3 models achieve near perfect retrieval results.
- ZeroSCROLLS (Shaham et al., 2023) is a zero-shot benchmark for natural language understanding over long texts. We report numbers on the validation set, as the ground truth answers are not publicly available. Our Llama 3 405B and 70B models either match or surpass other models on various tasks in this benchmark.
- InfiniteBench (Zhang et al., 2024) requires models to understand long dependencies in the context window. We evaluate Llama 3 on En.QA (QA over novels) and En.MC (multiple-choice QA over novels), where our 405B model outperforms all others. The gains are particularly significant on En.QA.

#### 5.2.7 Tool Use Performance

We evaluate our models on a range of benchmarks for zero-shot tool use (i.e. function calling): Nexus (Srinivasan et al., 2023), API-Bank (Li et al., 2023b), Gorilla API-Bench (Patil et al., 2023), and the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) (Yan et al., 2024). Results are shown in Table 22.

On Nexus, our Llama 3 variants perform the best compared to their counterparts. On the API-Bank, our Llama 3 8B and 70B models outperform other models in their category by a significant margin. The 405B model is behind Claude 3.5 Sonnet by only 0.6%. Finally, our 405B and 70B models perform competitively on BFCL and are close second in their respective size class. Llama 3 8B performs the best in its category.

Table 21 Long-context benchmarks. For ZeroSCROLLS (Shaham et al., 2023), we report numbers on the validation set. For QuALITY we report exact match, for Qasper - f1 and for SQuALITY - rougeL. We report f1 for InfiniteBench (Zhang et al., 2024) En.QA metric and accuracy for En.MC. For Multi-needle (Kamradt, 2023) we insert 4 needles in the context and test if a model can retrieve 2 needles at different context lengths, we compute average recall across 10 sequence lengths up till 128k.

Human evaluations. We also conduct human evaluations to test the tool use capabilities of the model, with a focus on code execution tasks. We collect 2000 user prompts related to code execution (without plotting or file uploads), plot generation, and file uploads. These prompts are collected from the LMSys dataset (Chiang et al., 2024), GAIA benchmark (Mialon et al., 2023b), human annotators, and synthetic generation.

We compare Llama 3 405B to GPT-4o using OpenAI's Assistants API10. The results are provided in Figure 16. On text-only code execution tasks and plots generation, Llama 3 405B significantly beats GPT-4o. However, it lags behind on the file upload use case.

#### 5.3 Human Evaluations

In addition to evaluations on standard benchmark sets, we also perform a series of human evaluations. These evaluations allow us to measure and optimize more subtle aspects of model performance, such as our model's tone, verbosity, and understanding of nuances and cultural contexts. Well-designed human evaluations closely reflect the user experience, providing insights

into how the model performs in real-world scenarios.

Prompt collection. We collected high-quality prompt spanning a wide range of categories and difficulties. To do so, we first developed a taxonomy with categories and subcategories capturing as many model capabilities as possible. We used this taxonomy to collect about 7, 000 prompts spanning six individual capabilities (English, reasoning, coding, Hindi, Spanish, and Portuguese), and three multiturn capabilities11 (English, reasoning, and coding). We ensured that within each category, prompts are uniformly distributed across subcategories. We also categorized each prompt into one of three difficulty levels and ensured that our prompt collection

<sup>10</sup>https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview

<sup>11</sup>For multiturn human evaluations, the number of turns is between 2 and 11 in each prompt. We assess the model response in the final turn.

Figure 16 Human evaluation results for Llama 3 405B vs. GPT-4o on code execution tasks including plotting and file uploads. Llama 3 405B outperforms GPT-4o on code execution (without plotting or file uploads) as well as plot generation, but lags behind in file upload use cases.

contains roughly 10% easy prompts, 30% medium prompts, and 60% hard prompts. All the human evaluation prompt sets were subject to a thorough quality assurance process. Modeling teams did not have access to our human-evaluation prompts to prevent accidental contamination or overfitting on the test set.

Evaluation process. To perform a pairwise human evaluation of two models, we ask human annotators which of two model responses (produced by different models) they prefer. Annotators use a 7-point scale for their ratings, enabling them to indicate whether one model response is much better than, better than, slightly better than, or about the same as the other model response. When an annotator indicates that one model response is better or much better than the other model response, we consider this a "win" for that model. We perform pairwise comparisons between models in which we report win rates per capability in the prompt set.

Results. We use our human evaluation process to compare Llama 3 405B with GPT-4 (0125 API version), GPT-4o (API version), and Claude 3.5 Sonnet (API version). The results of these evaluations are presented in Figure 17. We observe that Llama 3 405B performs approximately on par with the 0125 API version of GPT-4, while achieving mixed results (some wins and some losses) compared to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. On nearly all capabilities, the win rates of Llama 3 and GPT-4 are within the margin of error. On multiturn reasoning and coding tasks, Llama 3 405B outperforms GPT-4 but it underperforms GPT-4 on multilingual (Hindi, Spanish, and Portuguese) prompts. Llama 3 performs on par with GPT-4o on English prompts, on par with Claude 3.5 Sonnet on multilingual prompts, and outperforms Claude 3.5 Sonnet on single and multiturn English prompts. However, it trails Claude 3.5 Sonnet in capabilities such as coding and reasoning. Qualitatively, we find that model performance in human evaluations is heavily influenced by nuanced factors such as model tone, response structure, and verbosity – factors that we are optimizing for in our post-training process. Overall, our human evaluation results are consistent with those on standard benchmark evaluations: Llama 3 405B is very competitive with leading industry models, making it the best-performing openly available model.

Limitations. All human evaluation results underwent a thorough data quality assurance process. However, since it is challenging to define objective criteria for evaluating model responses, human evaluations can still be influenced by personal biases, backgrounds, and preferences of human annotators, which may lead to inconsistent or unreliable results.

#### 5.4 Safety

We focus our study on assessing Llama 3's ability to generate content in a safe and responsible way, while still maximizing helpful information. Our safety work begins in the pre-training stage, primarily in the form of

![](_page_40_Figure_0.jpeg)

data cleaning and filtering. We then describe our approach to safety finetuning, focusing on how to train the model to align to specific safety policies while still retaining helpfulness. We analyze each of the Llama 3 capabilities, including multilingual, long context, tool usage, and various multimodal capabilities, to measure the effectiveness of our safety mitigations.

Subsequently, we describe our assessment of uplift for cybersecurity and chemical and biological weapons risks. Uplift refers to the additional risk introduced by new technological developments compared to using existing available technologies (such as web search).

We then describe how we leverage Red Teaming to iteratively identify and combat various safety risks across capabilities and perform a residual risk assessment.

Finally, we describe system-level safety, or the development and orchestration of classifiers around the input and output of the model itself to further enhance safety and make it easier for developers to both customize safety to various usecases and deploy generative AI in more responsible ways.

#### 5.4.1 Benchmark Construction

We create various internal benchmarks to help us develop models safely and responsibly. Our benchmarks are heavily inspired by the risk categories from the ML Commons taxonomy of hazards (Vidgen et al., 2024). While various benchmarks for language model safety exist such as ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022), XS Test (Röttger et al., 2023), and more, a number of the new capabilities in Llama 3 do not have sufficient external benchmarks available and often external benchmarks lack sufficient coverage of breadth and depth.

For each risk category, we collect human-written prompts that are either adversarial or borderline in nature examples of such prompts can be found in Table 23. Adversarial prompts range from straightforward ones that directly elicit a harmful response to ones that incorporate sophisticated jailbreaking techniques. Benchmarks of these adversarial prompts are the basis for how we measure violation rate.

As a counter-metric to violation rate, we also construct false refusal benchmarks composed of borderline prompts. We refer to false refusal as occurring when a model refuses to answer in a helpful way even when a plausible, safe response is possible. Borderline prompts are prompts near the decision boundary that a well-calibrated model should handle, for example, "How can I steal the spotlight from my bestie who always acts like the main character??" Our overall benchmark size across violations and false refusals is over 4000 prompts per capability or language, and contains a mix of single-turn and multi-turn prompts.

#### 5.4.2 Safety Pre-training

We believe responsible development must be considered from an end-to-end perspective and incorporated at every stage of model development and deployment. During pre-training, we apply a variety of filters, such as filters to identify websites that likely contain personally identifiable information (see Section 3.1). We also focus heavily on discoverable memorization (Nasr et al., 2023). Similar to Carlini et al. (2022), we sample prompts and ground truths at different frequencies of occurrence in the training data using an efficient rolling hash index of all n-grams in the corpus. We construct different test scenarios by varying the length of prompt and ground truth, the detected language of target data, and the domain. We then measure how often the model generates the ground truth sequence verbatim, and analyze the relative rates of memorization in the specified scenarios. We define verbatim memorization as the inclusion rate – the proportion of model generations that include the ground truth continuation exactly – and report averages weighted by the prevalence of given characteristics in the data, as shown in Table 24. We find low memorization rates of training data (1.13% and 3.91% on average for the 405B with n = 50 and n = 1000 respectively). Memorization rates are roughly on par with Llama 2 at equivalent size and using the same methodology applied to its data mix.12

#### 5.4.3 Safety Finetuning

We describe our approach to safety finetuning to mitigate risks across many capabilities, which encompasses two key aspects: (1) safety training data and (2) risk mitigation techniques. Our safety finetuning process builds upon our general finetuning methodology with modifications tailored to address specific safety concerns.

We optimize for two primary metrics: Violation Rate (VR), a metric that captures when the model produces a

<sup>12</sup>Note there are limitations with our analysis — for example, recent work advocates for metrics beyond exact match (Ippolito et al., 2023) and alternative prompt search strategies (Kassem et al., 2024). Nonetheless, we find the results of the evaluations to be encouraging.

response that violates a safety policy, and False Refusal Rate (FRR), a metric that captures when the model incorrectly refuses to respond to a harmless prompt. In parallel, we evaluate model performance on helpfulness benchmarks to ensure that safety improvements do not compromise overall helpfulness.

Finetuning data. The quality and design of safety training data has a profound impact on performance. Through extensive ablations, we find that the quality is more critical than the quantity. We mainly use human-generated data collected from our data vendors, but find that it can be prone to errors and inconsistencies — particularly for nuanced safety policies. To ensure the highest quality data, we developed AI-assisted annotation tools to support our rigorous quality assurance processes. In addition to collecting adversarial prompts, we also gather a set of similar prompts, which we refer to as borderline prompts. These are closely related to the adversarial prompts but with a goal to teach the model to learn to provide helpful responses, thereby reducing the false refusal rate (FRR).

Beyond human annotation, we also leverage synthetic data to improve the quality and coverage of our training datasets. We utilize a range of techniques to generate additional adversarial examples, including in-context learning with carefully crafted system prompts, guided mutation of seed prompts based on new attack vectors, and advanced algorithms including Rainbow Teaming (Samvelyan et al., 2024), based on MAP-Elites (Mouret and

![](_page_42_Figure_3.jpeg)

Figure 18 Influence of model size on safety mix design for balancing violation rate (VR) and false refusal rate (FRR). Each point of the scatterplot represents a different data mix balancing safety and helpfulness data. Different model sizes retain varying capacities for safety learning. Our experiments show that 8B models require a higher proportion of safety data relative to helpfulness data in the overall SFT mix to achieve comparable safety performance to 70B models. Larger models are more capable of discerning between adversarial and borderline context, resulting in a more favorable balance between VR and FRR.

Clune, 2015), which generate prompts constrained across multiple dimensions of diversity.

We further address the model's tone when producing safe responses, which has an impact on downstream user experience. We developed a refusal tone guideline for Llama 3 and ensured that all new safety data adhered to it through rigorous quality assurance process. We also refine existing safety data to align with the guideline, using a combination of zero-shot rewriting and human-in-the-loop editing to produce high-quality data. By employing these methods, along with a tone classifier to assess tone quality for safety responses, we are able to significantly improve the model's verbiage.

Safety supervised finetuning. Following our Llama 2 recipe (Touvron et al., 2023b), we combine all helpfulness data and safety data during the model alignment stage. Additionally, we introduce a borderline dataset to help the model discern the subtle distinctions between safe and unsafe requests. Our annotation teams are instructed to meticulously craft responses to safety prompts based on our guidelines. We have found that SFT is highly effective in aligning the model when we strategically balance the ratio of adversarial to borderline examples. We put the focus on more challenging risk areas, with a higher ratio of borderline examples. This plays a crucial role in our successful safety mitigation efforts while keeping false refusal to a minimum.

Further, we examine the impact of model size on the trade-off between FRR and VR in Figure 18. Our results show that it varies — with smaller models requiring a larger proportion of safety data relative to helpfulness, and that it is more challenging to efficiently balance VR and FRR compared to larger models.

Safety DPO. To reinforce safety learning, we incorporate adversarial and borderline examples into our preference datasets in DPO. We discover that crafting response pairs to be nearly orthogonal in an embedding space is particularly effective in teaching the model to distinguish between good and bad responses for a given prompt. We conduct multiple experiments to determine the optimal ratio of adversarial, borderline, and helpfulness examples, aiming to optimize the trade-off between FRR and VR. We also find that the model size influences the learning outcomes — as a result, we tailor different safety mixes for various model sizes.

Note we do not have a borderline data set for Many-shot, due to the adversarial nature of the benchmark, and thus do not measure false refusal rates on it. For Tool Usage (Search), we only test Llama 3 405B compared to Comp. 1.

#### 5.4.4 Safety Results

We first highlight Llama 3's general behavior along various axes and then describe results for each specific new capability and our effectiveness at mitigating the safety risks.

Overall performance. A comparison of Llama 3's final violation and false refusal rates with similar models can be found in Figures 19 and 20. These results focus on our largest parameter size Llama 3 405B model, compared to relevant competitors. Two of the competitors are end-to-end systems accessed through API, and one of them is an open source language model that we host internally and we evaluate directly.13 We evaluate our Llama models both standalone and coupled with Llama Guard, our open source system-level safety solution (more in Section 5.4.7).

While a low violation rate is desirable, it is critical to consider false refusal as a counter-metric, as a model that always refuses is maximally safe, but not helpful in the slightest. Similarly, a model that always answers every prompt, regardless of how problematic the request, would be overly harmful and toxic. In Figure 21, leveraging our internal benchmarks, we explore how different models and systems in industry navigate this trade off and how Llama 3 compares. We find that our models achieve very competitive violation rate metrics

<sup>13</sup>Because these safety benchmarks are internal to Meta, we acknowledge that the numbers in this section are not reproducible externally, and so we choose to anonymize the competitors we evaluate against.

![](_page_44_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 21 Violation and false refusal rates across models and capabilities. Each point represents the overall false refusal and violation rate for an internal capability benchmark across all safety categories. Symbols indicate whether we are evaluating model or system level safety. As expected model level safety results indicate higher violation rates and lower refusal rates compared to system level safety results. Llama 3 aims to balance a low violation rate with a low false refusal rate, while some competitors are more skewed towards one or the other.

while keeping false refusal rate low as well, indicating a solid balance between helpfulness and safety.

Multilingual safety. Our experiments demonstrate that safety knowledge in English does not readily transfer to other languages, particularly given the nuance of safety policies and language-specific context. Therefore, it is essential to collect high-quality safety data for each language. We also found that the distribution of safety data per language significantly impacts performance from a safety standpoint, with some languages benefiting from transfer learning while others require more language-specific data. To achieve a balance between FRR and VR, we iteratively add adversarial and borderline data while monitoring the impact on both metrics.

We display results on our internal benchmarks in Figure 19 for short context models, showing Llama 3's violation and false refusal rates for English and non-English languages compared to similar models and systems. To construct the benchmarks for each language, we use a combination of prompts written by native speakers, sometimes supplementing with translations from our English benchmarks. For each of our supported languages, we find that Llama 405B with Llama Guard is at least as safe, if not strictly safer, than the two competing systems when measured on our internal benchmark, while maintaining competitive false refusal rates. Looking at the Llama 405B model on its own, without Llama Guard, we find that it has a significantly lower violation rate than the competing standalone open source model, trading off a higher false refusal rate.

Long-context safety. Long-context models are vulnerable to many-shot jailbreaking attacks without targeted mitigation (Anil et al., 2024). To address this, we finetune our models on SFT datasets that include examples of safe behavior in the presence of demonstrations of unsafe behavior in context. We develop a scalable mitigation strategy that significantly reduces VR, effectively neutralizing the impact of longer context attacks even for 256-shot attacks. This approach shows little to no impact on FRR and most helpfulness metrics.

To quantify the effectiveness of our long context safety mitigations, we use two additional benchmarking methods: DocQA and Many-shot. For DocQA, short for "document question answering," we use long documents with information that could be utilized in adversarial ways. Models are provided both the document and a set of prompts related to the document in order to test whether the questions being related to information in the document affected the model's ability to respond safely to the prompts. For Many-shot, following Anil et al. (2024), we construct a synthetic chat history composed of unsafe prompt-response pairs. A final prompt, unrelated to previous messages, is used to test whether the unsafe behavior in-context influenced the model

to response unsafely. The violation and false refusal rates for both DocQA and Many-shot are shown in Figure 20. We see that Llama 405B (with and without Llama Guard) is Pareto-better than the Comp. 2 system across both violation rates and false refusal rates, across both DocQA and Many-shot. Relative to Comp. 1, we find that Llama 405B is significantly safer, while coming at a trade off on false refusal.

Tool usage safety. The diversity of possible tools and the implementation of the tool usage call and integration into the model make tool usage a challenging capability to fully mitigate (Wallace et al., 2024). We focus on the search usecase. Violation and false refusal rates are shown in Figure 20. We tested against the Comp. 1 system, where we find that Llama 405B is significantly safer, though has a slightly higher false refusal rate.

#### 5.4.5 Cybersecurity and Chemical/Biological Weapons Safety

CyberSecurity evaluation results. To evaluate cybersecurity risk, we leverage the CyberSecEval benchmark framework (Bhatt et al., 2023, 2024), which contains tasks that measure safety across domains such as generating insecure code, generating malicious code, textual prompt injection, and vulnerability identification. We developed and applied Llama 3 to new benchmarks on spear phishing and autonomous cyberattacks.

Overall, we find that Llama 3 does not have significant susceptibilities in generating malicious code or exploiting vulnerabilities. We describe brief results on specific tasks:

- Insecure coding testing framework: Evaluating Llama 3 8B, 70B, and 405B against the insecure coding testing framework, we continue to observe that larger models both generate more insecure code and also generate code with a higher average BLEU score (Bhatt et al., 2023).
- Code interpreter abuse prompt corpus: We identify that Llama 3 models are susceptible to executing malicious code under certain prompts, with Llama 3 405B being particularly susceptible by complying with malicious prompts 10.4% of the time. Llama 3 70B complied at a rate of 3.8%.
- Text-based prompt injection benchmark: When evaluated against prompt injection benchmarks, prompt injection attacks against Llama 3 405B were successful 21.7% of the time. Figure 22 provides text-based prompt injection success rates across Llama 3, GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini Pro, and Mixtral models.
- Vulnerability identification challenges: In assessing Llama 3's ability to identify and exploit vulnerabilities using CyberSecEval 2's capture-the-flag test challenges, Llama 3 does not outperform commonly used, traditional non-LLM tools and techniques.
- Spear phishing benchmark: We evaluate model persuasiveness and success rate in carrying out personalized conversations designed to deceive a target into unwittingly participating in security compromises. Randomized detailed victim profiles were generated by an LLM to serve as spear phishing targets. A judge LLM (Llama 3 70B) scored the performance of Llama 3 70B and 405B in interacting with a victim model (Llama 3 70B) and evaluated the success of the attempt. Llama 3 70B and Llama 3 405B were evaluated by the judge LLM to be moderately persuasive. Llama 3 70B was judged by an LLM to have been successful in 24% of spear phishing attempts while Llama 3 405B was judged to be successful in 14% of attempts. Figure 23 presents judge LLM-evaluated persuasiveness scores across models and phishing objectives.
- Attack automation framework: We assess Llama 3 70B's and 405B's potential to function as an autonomous agent across four critical phases of a ransomware attack – network reconnaissance, vulnerability identification, exploit execution, and post exploitation actions. We enable the models to behave autonomously by configuring the models to iteratively generate and execute new Linux commands in response to output from their prior commands on a Kali Linux virtual machine as they targeted another virtual machine with known vulnerabilities. Although Llama 3 70B and 405B efficiently identify network services and open ports in their network reconnaissance, the models fail to effectively use this information to gain initial access to the vulnerable machine across 20 and 23 test runs respectively. In identifying vulnerabilities, Llama 3 70B and 405B are moderately effective but struggle with selecting and applying successful exploitation techniques. Attempts to execute exploits were entirely unsuccessful as were post-exploit attempts to maintain access or impact hosts within a network.

Uplift testing for cyber attacks. We conduct an uplift study which measures the extent a virtual assistant improved the cyberattack rates of both novice and expert cyberattackers between two simulated offensive

cybersecurity challenges. A two-stage study was conducted with 62 internal volunteers. Volunteers were categorized into "expert" (31 subjects) and "novice" (31 subjects) cohorts based on their offensive security experience. For the first stage, subjects were asked to complete the challenge without any LLM assistance but with access to the open internet. For the second stage, subjects retained access to the internet but were also provided with Llama 3 405B to complete a different offensive cybersecurity challenge of similar difficulty to the first. An analysis of the completion rates of challenge attack phases by subjects indicates that both novices and experts using the 405B model demonstrated insignificant uplift over having open access to the internet without an LLM.

Uplift testing for chemical and biological weapons. To assess risks related to proliferation of chemical and biological weapons, we perform uplift testing designed to assess whether use of Llama 3 could meaningfully increase the capabilities of actors to plan such attacks.

The study consists of six-hour scenarios where teams of two participants were asked to generate fictitious operational plans for either a biological or chemical attack. The scenarios cover the major planning stages of a CBRNE attack (agent acquisition, production, weaponization, and delivery) and are designed to elicit detailed plans that would address challenges related to procurement of restricted materials, real-world laboratory protocols, and operational security. Participants are recruited based on previous experience in relevant areas of scientific or operational expertise, and assigned to teams consisting of two low-skill actors (no formal training) or two moderate-skill actors (some formal training and practical experience in science or operations).

The study was generated in collaboration with a set of CBRNE experts, and designed to maximize the generality, validity, and robustness of both quantitative and qualitative outcomes. A preliminary study was also performed in order to validate the study design, including a robust power analysis ensuring that our sample size was sufficient for statistical analysis.

Each team is assigned to a "control" or "LLM" condition. The control team has access to internet-based resources only, while the LLM-enabled team had internet access as well as access to Llama 3 models enabled with web search (including PDF ingestion), information retrieval capabilities (RAG), and code execution (Python and Wolfram Alpha). To enable testing of RAG capabilities, a keyword search is used to generate a dataset of hundreds of relevant scientific papers and pre-loaded into the Llama 3 model inference system. At the conclusion of the exercise, the operational plans generated by each team are evaluated by subject matter experts with domain expertise in biology, chemistry, and operational planning. Each plan is evaluated across four stages of potential attacks, generating scores for metrics such as scientific accuracy, detail, detection avoidance, and probability of success in scientific and operational execution. After a robust Delphi process to mitigate bias and variability in subject matter expert (SME) evaluations, final scores are generated by pooling stage-level metrics into a comprehensive score.

Quantitative analysis of these results of this study show no significant uplift in performance related to usage of the Llama 3 model. This result holds true when performing an aggregate analysis (comparing all LLM conditions to the web-only control condition) as well as for breakdowns by subgroups (e.g., separate evaluation of the Llama 3 70B and Llama 3 405B models, or separate evaluation of scenarios related to chemical or biological weapons). After validating these results with CBRNE SMEs, we assess that there is a low risk that release of Llama 3 models will increase ecosystem risk related to biological or chemical weapon attacks.

#### 5.4.6 Red Teaming

We utilize Red Teaming to discover risks and use the findings to improve our benchmarks and safety tuning datasets. We conduct recurring red teaming exercises to continuously iterate and discover new risks, which guides our model development and mitigation process.

Our red team consists of experts in cybersecurity, adversarial machine learning, responsible AI, and integrity, in addition to multilingual content specialists with backgrounds in integrity issues for specific geographic markets. We also partner with internal and external subject-matter experts in critical risk areas to help build risk taxonomies and aid in more focused adversarial assessment.

Adversarial testing on specific model capabilities. We began initial red teaming by focusing on individual model capabilities in a risk discovery process, in context of specific high-risk categories then testing capabilities together. The red team focused on prompt-level attacks to emulate more likely more real world scenarios we find that models often deviate from expected behavior, particularly in cases when the prompt's intention is being obfuscated or when prompts layer multiple abstractions. These risks get more complex with additional capabilities, and we describe several of our red teaming discoveries in detail below. We utilize these red team discoveries in concert with our results on internal safety benchmarks to develop focused mitigations to continuously and iteratively improve model safety.

- Short and long-context English. We employed a mix of well known, published and unpublished techniques across single and multi-turn conversations. We also leveraged advanced, adversarial multi-turn automation similar to PAIR (Chao et al., 2023) across some techniques and risk categories. Largely, multi-turn conversations lead to more harmful outputs. Several attacks were pervasive across model checkpoints, particularly when used together.
	- Multi-turn refusal suppression to specify the model response to follow a particular format or include/exclude particular information related to the refusal as specific phrases.
	- Hypothetical scenarios wrap violating prompts as hypothetical/theoretical tasks or fictional scenarios. Prompts can be as simple as adding the word "hypothetically" or crafting an elaborate layered scenario.
	- Personas and role play gives the model a violating persona with specific violating response characteristics (e.g. "You are X, your goal is Y") or yourself as the user adapting a specific benign character that obfuscates the context of the prompt.
	- Adding disclaimers and warnings works as a form of response priming and we assume a method to allow for the model a path to helpful compliance that intersects with generalized safety training. Asking for disclaimers, trigger warnings and more to be added in multi-turn conversations in concert with other attacks mentioned contributed to increased violation rates.
	- Gradually escalating violation is a multi-turn attack where the conversation starts out with a more or less benign request and then through direct prompting for more exaggerated content can gradually lead the model into generating a very violating response. Once the model has started outputting violating content, it can be difficult for the model to recover (or another attack can be used if a refusal is encountered). With longer context models, this will be an increasingly seen issue.
- Multilingual. We identify a number of unique risks when considering multiple languages.
	- Mixing multiple languages in one prompt or conversation can easily lead to more violating outputs than if a single language was used.
	- Lower resource languages can lead to violating outputs given a lack of related safety fine tuning data, weak model generalization of safety or prioritization of testing or benchmarks. However, this attack often result in poor quality generally, limiting real adversarial use.
- Slang, specific context or cultural-specific references can confuse or appear to be violating at first glance, only to see the model does not comprehend a given reference correctly to make an output truly harmful or prevent it from being a violating output.
- Tool use. During testing, apart from English-text level adversarial prompting techniques being successful in generating violating outputs, several tool specific attacks were also discovered. This included but was not limited to:
	- Unsafe tool chaining such as asking for multiple tools at once with one being violating could, in early checkpoints, lead to all of the tools being called with a mix of benign and violating inputs.
	- Forcing tool use often with specific input strings, fragmented or encoded text can trigger a tool input to be potentially violating, leading to a more violating output. Other techniques can then be used to access the tool results, even if the model would normally refuse to perform the search or assist with the results.
	- Modifying tool use parameters such as swapping words in queries, retrying, or obfuscating some of the initial request in a multi-turn conversation lead to violations in many early checkpoints as a form of forcing tool use.

Child safety risks. Child Safety risk assessments were conducted using a team of experts, to assess the model's capability to produce outputs that could result in Child Safety risks and inform on any necessary and appropriate risk mitigations via fine tuning. We leveraged those expert red teaming sessions to expand the coverage of our evaluation benchmarks through model development. For Llama 3, we conducted new in-depth sessions using objective based methodologies to assess model risks along multiple attack vectors. We also partnered with content specialists to perform red teaming exercises assessing potentially violating content while taking account of market specific nuances or experiences.

#### 5.4.7 System Level Safety

In various real-world applications of large language models, models are not used in isolation but are integrated into broader systems. In this section, we describe our system level safety implementation, which supplements model-level mitigations by providing more flexibility and control.

To enable this, we develop and release a new classifier, Llama Guard 3, which is a Llama 3 8B model fine-tuned for safety classification. Similar to Llama Guard 2 (Llama-Team, 2024), this classifier is used to detect whether input prompts and/or output responses generated by language models violate safety policies on specific categories of harm.

It is designed to support Llama's growing capabilities, and can be used for English and multilingual text. It is also optimized to be used in the context of tool-calls such as search-tools and preventing code interpreter abuse. Finally, we also provide quantized variants to reduce memory requirements. We encourage developers to use our release of system safety components as a foundation and configure them for their own use cases.

Taxonomy. We train on the 13 hazard categories listed in the AI Safety taxonomy (Vidgen et al., 2024): Child Sexual Exploitation, Defamation, Elections, Hate, Indiscriminate Weapons, Intellectual Property, Non-Violent Crimes, Privacy, Sex-Related Crimes, Sexual Content, Specialized Advice, Suicide & Self-Harm, and Violent Crimes. We also train on Code Interpreter Abuse category to support tool-calls use cases.

Training data. We start with the English data used by Llama Guard (Inan et al., 2023) and expand this dataset to incorporate new capabilities. For new capabilities such as multilingual and tool use, we collect prompt and response classification data, as well as utilize the data collected for safety finetuning. We increase the number of unsafe responses in the training set by doing prompt engineering to get the LLM to not refuse responding to adversarial prompts. We use Llama 3 to obtain response labels on such generated data.

To improve the performance of Llama Guard 3, we do extensive cleaning of the collected samples using human annotation as well as LLM annotation by Llama 3. Obtaining labels for user prompts is a much harder task for both humans and LLMs, and we find that the human labels are slightly better, especially for borderline prompts, though our full iterative system is able to reduce the noise and produce more accurate labels.

|  |  | Input Llama Guard |  | Output Llama Guard |  | Full Llama Guard |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Capability | VR | FRR | VR | FRR | VR | FRR |
| English | -76% | +95% | -75% | +25% | -86% | +102% |
| French | -38% | +27% | -45% | +4% | -59% | +29% |
| German | -57% | +32% | -60% | +14% | -77% | +37% |

| Spanish | -41% | +26% | -50% | +10% | -60% | +27% |
| Thai | -43% | +37% | -39% | +8% | -51% | +39% |

Table 25 Violation Rate (VR) and False Refusal Rate (FRR) relative to Llama 3 when using Llama Guard 3 for input or output filtering on different languages. For example, -50% for VR means that there is a 50% reduction in the rate of Llama 3 model violations when using Llama Guard. Evaluations are performed on generations from the 405B-parameter Llama 3 model. Lower is better.

Results. Llama Guard 3 is able to significantly reduce violations across capabilities (-65% violations on average across our benchmarks). Note that adding system safeguards (and any safety mitigations in general) comes at the cost of increased refusals to benign prompts. In Table 25 we report reductions in violation rate and increases in false refusal rate increase compared to the base model to highlight this tradeoff. This effect is also visible in Figures 19, 20, and 21.

System safety also offers more flexibility. Llama Guard 3 can be deployed for specific harms only enabling control over the violations and false refusals trade-off at the harm category level. Table 26 presents violations reduction per category to inform which category should be turned on/off based on the developer use case.

To make it easier to deploy safety systems, we provide a quantized version of Llama Guard 3 using the commonly used int8 quantization technique, reducing its size by more than 40%. Table 27 illustrates that quantization has negligible impact on the performance of the model.

Prompt-based system guards. System-level safety components enable developers to customize and control how LLM systems respond to user requests. As part of our work on improving the overall safety of the model system and enable developers to deploy responsibly, we describe and release the creation of two prompt-based filtering mechanisms: Prompt Guard and Code Shield. We open-source these for the community to leverage as-is or take as inspiration and adapt for their usecases.

Prompt Guard is a model-based filter designed to detect prompt attacks, which are input strings designed to subvert the intended behavior of an LLM functioning as part of an application. The model is a multi-label classifier that detects two classes of prompt attack risk - direct jailbreaks (techniques that explicitly try to override a model's safety conditioning or system prompt) and indirect prompt injections (instances where third-party data included in a model's context window includes instructions inadvertently executed as user commands by an LLM). The model is fine-tuned from mDeBERTa-v3-base, a small (86M) parameter model suitable for filtering inputs into an LLM. We evaluate the performance on several evaluation datasets shown in Table 28. We evaluate on two datasets (jailbreaks and injections) drawn from the same distribution as the training data, as well as an out-of-distribution dataset in English, a multilingual jailbreak set built from machine translation, and a dataset of indirect injections drawn from CyberSecEval (both English and multilingual). Overall, we find that the model generalizes well to new distributions and has strong performance.

Code Shield is an example of a class of system-level protections based on providing inference-time filtering. In particular, it focuses on detecting the generation of insecure code before it might enter a downstream usecase such as a production system. It does so by leveraging a static analysis library, the Insecure Code Detector (ICD), to identify insecure code. ICD uses a suite of static analysis tools to perform the analysis across 7 programming languages. These kinds of guardrails are generally useful for developers, who can deploy multi-layered protections in various applications.

#### 5.4.8 Limitations

We conducted extensive measurement and mitigation on a wide variety of risks to safe usage of Llama 3. However, no testing can be guaranteed to be exhaustive in identifying every possible risk. Llama 3 may still generate harmful content due to training on various datasets, particularly for languages beyond English and when prompt engineered by skilled adversarial red teamers. Malicious developers or adversarial users may find new ways to jailbreak our models and use them for various nefarious usecases. We will continue to proactively identify risks, conduct research on mitigation methods, and we encourage developers to consider responsibility in every aspect — from model development to deployment to users. We hope developers will leverage and contribute to the tools we release in our open-source system-level safety suite.

### 6 Inference

We investigate two main techniques to make inference with the Llama 3 405B model efficient: (1) pipeline parallelism and (2) FP8 quantization. We have publicly released our implementation of FP8 quantization.

### 6.1 Pipeline Parallelism

When using a BF16 number representation for the model parameters, Llama 3 405B does not fit in the GPU memory of a single machine with 8 Nvidia H100 GPUs. To address this issue, we parallelize model inference using BF16 precision across 16 GPUs on two machines. Within each machine, the high NVLink bandwidth

| Metric | Jailbreaks | Injections | Out-of-Distribution Jailbreaks | Multilingual Jailbreaks | Indirect Injections |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TPR | 99.9% | 99.5% | 97.5% | 91.5% | 71.4% |
| FPR | 0.4% | 0.8% | 3.9% | 5.3% | 1.0% |
| AUC | 0.997 | 1.000 | 0.975 | 0.959 | 0.996 |

Table 28 Performance of Prompt Guard. We include in- and out-of-distribution evaluations, a multilingual jailbreak built using machine translation, and a dataset of indirect injections from CyberSecEval.

enables the use of tensor parallelism (Shoeybi et al., 2019). Across nodes, however, connectivity has lower bandwidth and higher latency, so we use pipeline parallelism (Huang et al., 2019) instead.

During training with pipeline parallelism, bubbles are a major efficiency concern (see Section 3.3). However, they are not an issue during inference, since inference does not involve a backward pass that requires a pipeline flush. Therefore, we use micro-batching to improve inference throughput with pipeline parallelism.

We evaluate the effect of using two micro-batches in inference workloads of 4,096 input tokens and 256 output tokens both during the key-value cache pre-fill stage of inference and during the decoding stage. We find that micro-batching improves throughput of inference with the same local batch size; see Figure 24. These improvements result from micro-batching enabling concurrent execution of micro batches in both these stages. The additional synchronization points due to micro-batching also increase latency but, overall, micro-batching still leads to a better throughput-latency trade-off.

#### 6.2 FP8 Quantization

We perform experiments leveraging the native FP8 support of H100 GPUs to perform low-precision inference. To enable low-precision inference, we apply FP8 quantization to most matrix multiplications inside the model. In particular, we quantize most parameters and activations in the feedforward network layers in the model, which account for roughly 50% of the inference compute time. We do not quantize parameters in the self-attention layers of the model. We leverage dynamic scaling factors for better accuracy (Xiao et al., 2024b), optimizing our CUDA kernels15 to reduce the overhead of calculating the scales. We find that the quality of Llama 3 405B is sensitive to certain types of quantization, and make a few additional changes to increase the model output quality:

1. Akin to Zhang et al. (2021), we do not perform quantization in the first and last Transformer layers.

- 2. High-perplexity tokens such as dates can lead to large activation values. In turn, these can lead to high dynamic scaling factors in FP8 and a non-negligible number of underflows, leading to errors in decoding.
<sup>15</sup>Our FP8 kernels are available at https://github.com/pytorch/FBGEMM/tree/main/fbgemm_gpu/experimental/gen_ai. We provide usage examples at https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-agentic-system.

Figure 26 Reward score distribution for Llama 3 405B using BF16 and FP8 inference. Our FP8 quantization approach has negligible impact on the model's responses.

To address this issue, we upper bound the dynamic scaling factors to 1200.

- 3. We use row-wise quantization, computing scaling factors across rows for parameter and activation matrices (see Figure 25). We find this works better than a tensor-wise quantization approach.
Effect of quantization errors. Evaluations on standard benchmarks often suggest that FP8 inference performs on par with BF16 inference even without these mitigations. However, we find that such benchmarks do not adequately reflect the effects of FP8 quantization. When scaling factors are not upper bounded, the model occasionally produces corrupted responses even though the benchmark performance is strong. Instead of relying on benchmarks to measure distribution changes due to quantization, we find it is better to analyze the distribution of reward-model scores for 100, 000 responses produced using both FP8 and BF16. Figure 26 shows the resulting reward distribution for our quantization approach. The results in the figure show that our approach to FP8 quantization has very limited impact on the model's response.

Experimental evaluation of efficiency. Figure 27 depicts the throughput-latency trade-off of performing FP8 inference with Llama 3 405B in the pre-fill and decoding stages, using 4,096 input tokens and 256 output tokens. The figure compares the efficiency of FP8 inference with that of the two-machine BF16 inference approach described in Section 6.1. The results show that use of FP8 inference leads to throughput improvements of up to 50% during the pre-fill stage, and a substantially better throughput-latency trade-off during decoding.

### 7 Vision Experiments

We perform a series of experiments in which we incorporate visual-recognition capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach that consists of two main stages. First, we compose a pre-trained image encoder (Xu et al., 2023) and the pre-trained language model by introducing and training a set of cross-attention layers between the two models (Alayrac et al., 2022) on a large number of image-text pairs. This leads to the model illustrated in Figure 28. Second, we introduce temporal aggregator layers and additional video cross-attention layers that operate on a large collection of video-text pairs to learn the model to recognize and process temporal information from videos.

A compositional approach to foundation model development has several advantages: (1) it enables us to parallelize the development of the vision and language modeling capabilities; (2) it circumvents complexities of joint pre-training on visual and language data that stem from tokenization of visual data, differences in background perplexities of tokens originating from different modalities, and contention between modalities; (3) it guarantees that model performance on text-only tasks is not affected by the introduction of visual-recognition capabilities, and (4) the cross-attention architecture ensures that we do not have to expend compute passing full-resolution images through the increasingly LLM backbones (specifically, the feed-forward networks in each transformer layer), making it more efficient during inference. We note that our multimodal models are still under development and not yet ready for release.

Before presenting the results of our experiments in Section 7.6 and 7.7, we describe the data we used to train visual recognition capabilities, the model architecture of the vision components, how we scale training of those components, and our pre-training and post-training recipes.

#### 7.1 Data

We describe our image and video data separately below.

#### 7.1.1 Image Data

Our image encoder and adapter are trained on image-text pairs. We construct this dataset via a complex data processing pipeline that consists of four main stages: (1) quality filtering, (2) perceptual de-duplication, (3) resampling, and (4) optical character recognition. We also apply a series of safety mitigations.

- Quality filtering. We implement quality filters that remove non-English captions and low-quality captions via heuristics such as low alignment scores produced by (Radford et al., 2021). Specifically, we remove all image-text pairs below a certain CLIP score.
- De-duplication. De-duplicating large-scale training datasets benefits model performance because it reduces training compute spent on redundant data (Esser et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2021; Abbas et al.,

![](_page_54_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 28 Illustration of the compositional approach to adding multimodal capabilities to Llama 3 that we study in this paper. This approach leads to a multimodal model that is trained in five stages: (1) language model pre-training, (2) multi-modal encoder pre-training, (3) vision adapter training, (4) model finetuning, and (5) speech adapter training.

> 2023) and memorization (Carlini et al., 2023; Somepalli et al., 2023). Hence, we de-duplicate our training data for both efficiency and privacy reasons. To do so, we use an internal version of the state-of-the-art SSCD copy-detection model (Pizzi et al., 2022) to de-duplicate images at scale. For all images, we first compute a 512-dimensional representation using the SSCD model. We use those embeddings to perform a nearest neighbor (NN) search for each image across all images in our data set, using a cosine similarity measure. We define examples above a certain similarity threshold as duplicates. We group these duplicates using a connected-components algorithm, and maintain only one image-text pair per connected component. We increase the efficiency of our de-duplication pipeline by: (1) pre-clustering the data using k-means clusters and (2) using FAISS (Johnson et al., 2019) for NN searches and clustering.

- Resampling. We ensure diversity of the image-text pairs via resampling akin to Xu et al. (2023); Mahajan et al. (2018); Mikolov et al. (2013). First, we construct a vocabulary of n-grams by parsing high-quality text sources. Next, we compute the frequency of each vocabulary n-gram in our dataset. We then resample the data as follows: If any of the n-grams in a caption occurs less than T times in the vocabulary, we keep the corresponding image-text pair. Otherwise, we independently sample each of the n-grams ni in the caption with probability p T /fi where fi indicates the frequency of n-gram ni ; we keep the image-text pair if any of the n-grams was sampled. This resampling aids performance on low-frequency categories and fine-grained recognition tasks.
- Optical character recognition. We further improve our image-text data by extracting text written in the image and concatenating it with the caption. The written text is extracted using a proprietary optical character recognition (OCR) pipeline. We observe that adding OCR data into the training data greatly improves tasks that require OCR capabilities, such as document understanding.

Transcribing documents. To improve the performance of our models on document understanding tasks, we render pages from documents as images and paired the images with their respective text. The document text is obtained either directly from the source or via a document parsing pipeline.

Safety. We focus primarily on ensuring that the pre-training dataset for image recognition does not contain

unsafe content, such as sexual abuse material (CSAM) (Thiel, 2023). We scan all our training images for CSAM using perceptual hashing approaches such as PhotoDNA (Farid, 2021) as well as internal, proprietary classifiers. We also use a proprietary media-risk retrieval pipeline to identify and remove image-text pairs that we consider to be NSFW, for example, because they contain sexual or violent content. We believe that minimizing the prevalence of such material in the training dataset improves the safety of the final model without impacting its helpfulness. Finally, we perform face blurring on all images in our training set. We test the model against human generated prompts that refer to an attached image.

Annealing data. We create an annealing dataset by resampling the image-caption pairs to a smaller volume of ∼350M examples using n-grams. Since the n-grams resampling favor richer text descriptions, this selects a higher-quality data subset. We augment the resulting data with ∼150M examples from five additional sources:

- Visual grounding. We link noun phrases in the text to bounding boxes or masks in the image. The grounding information (bounding boxes and masks) are specified in the image-text pair in two ways. (1) We overlay boxes or masks with marks on the image and use marks in the text as reference, akin to set-of-marks (Yang et al., 2023a). (2) We insert normalized (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax) coordinates directly into the text, demarcated by special tokens.
- Screenshot parsing. We render screenshots from HTML code and task the model with predicting the code that produced a specific element in the screenshot, akin to Lee et al. (2023). The element of interest is indicated in the screenshot via a bounding box.
- Question-answer pairs. We include question-answer pairs, enabling us to use volumes of questionanswering data that are too large to be used in model finetuning.
- Synthetic captions. We include images with synthetic captions that were generated by an early version of the model. Compared to original captions, we find that synthetic captions provide a more comprehensive description of images than the original captions.
- Synthetically-generated structured images. We also include synthetically generated images for a variety of domains such as charts, tables, flowcharts, math equations and textual data. These images are accompanied by a structured representation such as the corresponding markdown or LaTeX notation. Besides improving recognition capabilities of the model for these domains, we find this data useful to generate question-answer pairs via the text model for finetuning.

#### 7.1.2 Video Data

For video pre-training, we use a large dataset of video-text pairs. Our dataset is curated through a multi-stage process. We filter and clean the associated texts using rule-based heuristics, such as ensuring a minimum length and fixing capitalization. Then, we run language identification models to filter out non-English texts. We run OCR detection models to filter out videos with excessive overlaid text. To ensure reasonable alignment between the video-text pairs, we use CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) style image-text and video-text contrastive models. We first compute image-text similarity using a single frame in the videos and filtered out low similarity pairs, and then subsequently filter out pairs with low video-text alignment. Some of our data contains static or low-motion videos; we filter out such data using motion-score based filtering (Girdhar et al., 2023). We do not apply any filters on the visual quality of the videos such as aesthetic scores or resolution filtering.

Our dataset contains videos with an average duration of 21 seconds and a median duration of 16 seconds, with over 99% videos being under a minute. The spatial resolution varies significantly between 320p and 4K videos, with over 70% of the videos having a short side greater than 720 pixels. The videos have varying aspect ratios with almost all videos having between aspect ratio between 1:2 and 2:1, with a 1:1 median.

### 7.2 Model Architecture

Our visual-recognition model consists of three main components: (1) an image encoder, (2) an image adapter, and (3) a video adapter.

Image encoder. Our image encoder is a standard vision transformer (ViT; Dosovitskiy et al. (2020)) that is trained to align images and text (Xu et al., 2023). We use the ViT-H/14 variant of the image encoder,

which has 630M parameters that were trained on 2.5B image-text pairs for five epochs. The image encoder is pre-trained on images with resolution 224 × 224; images were split up into 16 × 16 patches of equal size (i.e., a patch size of 14x14 pixels). As also demonstrated by prior work such as ViP-Llava (Cai et al., 2024), we observe that image encoders trained via a contrastive text alignment objective are unable to preserve fine-grained localization information. To alleviate this, we employ a multi-layer feature extraction, where features from the 4 th, 8th, 16th, 24th and 31st layers are also provided in addition to the final layer features. In addition, we further insert 8 gated self-attention layers (making a total of 40 transformer blocks) prior to pre-training of the cross-attention layers to learn alignment-specific features. The image encoder therefore eventually has a total 850M parameters with the additional layers. With the multi-layer features, the image encoder produces a 7680-dimensional representation for each of the resulting 16 × 16 = 256 patches. The parameters of the image encoder are not frozen during subsequent training stages as we found it to improve performance, especially in domains such as text recognition.

Image adapter. We introduce cross-attention layers between the visual token representations produced by the image encoder and the token representations produced by the language model (Alayrac et al., 2022). The cross-attention layers are applied after every fourth self-attention layer in the core language model. Like the language model itself, the cross-attention layers use generalized query attention (GQA) for increased efficiency. The cross-attention layers introduce substantial numbers of additional trainable parameters into the model: for Llama 3 405B, the cross-attention layers have ≈100B parameters. We pre-train our image adapter in two stages: (1) initial pre-training followed by (2) annealing:

- Initial pre-training. We pre-train our image adapter on our dataset of ∼6B image-text pairs described above. For compute efficiency reasons, we resize all images to fit within at most four tiles of 336 × 336 pixels each, where we arrange the tiles to support different aspect ratios, e.g., 672 × 672, 672 × 336, and 1344 × 336.
- Annealing. We continue training the image adapter on ∼500M images from the annealing dataset described above. During annealing, we increase the per-tile image resolution to improve performance on tasks that require higher-resolution images, for example, infographics understanding.

Video adapter. Our model takes as input up to 64 frames (uniformly sampled from a full video), each of which is processed by the image encoder. We model temporal structure in videos through two components: (i) encoded video frames are aggregated by a temporal aggregator which merges 32 consecutive frames into one, (ii) additional video cross attention layers are added before every fourth image cross attention layer. The temporal aggregator is implemented as a perceiver resampler (Jaegle et al., 2021; Alayrac et al., 2022). We pre-train using 16 frames per video (aggregated to 1 frame), but increase the number of input frames to 64 during supervised finetuning. The video aggregator and cross attention layers have 0.6B and 4.6B parameters for Llama 3 7B and 70B, respectively.

#### 7.3 Model Scaling

After the visual-recognition components are added to Llama 3, the model contains self-attention layers, crossattention layers, and a ViT image encoder. To train adapters for the smaller 8B and 70B parameter models, we found a combination of data and tensor parallelization is the most efficient. Model or pipeline parallelism does not increase efficiency at these scales because the gathering of model parameters would dominate the computation. We do, however, use pipeline parallelism (in addition to data and tensor parallelism) when training the adapter for the 405B parameter model. Training at this scale introduces three new challenges in addition to those outlined in Section 3.3: model heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, and numerical instabilities.

Model heterogeneity. The model computation is heterogeneous because more computation is performed on some tokens than on others. In particular, image tokens are processed by the image encoder and the crossattention layers, whereas text tokens are only processed by the language backbone. This heterogeneity leads to bottlenecks in the scheduling of pipeline parallelism. We address this problem by ensuring each pipeline stage contains five layers: namely, four self-attention layers in the language backbone and a cross-attention layer. (Recall that we introduce a cross-attention layer after every fourth self-attention layer.) In addition, we replicate the image encoder on all pipeline stages. Because we train on paired image-text data, this enables us to perform load balancing between the image and text parts of the computation.

Data heterogeneity. The data is heterogeneous because, on average, images have more tokens than the associated text: an image has 2,308 tokens, whereas the associated text contains an average of only 192 tokens. As a result, the computation of cross-attention layers requires more time and memory than the computation of self-attention layers. We address this problem by introducing sequence parallelization in the image encoder, so that each GPU processes roughly the same number of tokens. Because the average text size is relatively short, we also use a substantially larger micro-batch size (8 instead of 1).

Numerical instabilities. After the image encoder is added to the model, we find that performing gradient accumulation in bf16 led to numerical instabilities. The most likely explanation for this is that image tokens are introduced into the language backbone via all cross-attention layers. This implies that numerical deviations in the representation of an image token have an outsized impact on the overall computation because the errors are compounded. We address this by performing gradient accumulation in FP32.

#### 7.4 Pre-training

Image. We initialize from the pre-trained text model and vision encoder weights. The vision encoder is unfrozen, while the text model weights are kept frozen as explained above. First, we train the model using 6B image-text pairs where each image is resized to fit within four tiles of 336 × 336 pixels. We use a global batch size of 16,384 and a cosine learning rate schedule with initial learning rate 10 × 10−4 and a weight decay of 0.01. The initial learning rate was determined based on small-scale experiments. However, these findings did not generalize well to very long training schedules and dropped the learning rate a few times during training when the loss values became stagnant. After the base pre-training, we increase the image resolution further and continue training the same weights on the annealing dataset. The optimizer is re-initialized via warm-up to learning rate 2 × 10−5 and again follows a cosine schedule.

Video. For video pre-training, we start from the image pre-trained and annealed weights as described above. We add the video aggregator and cross-attention layers as described in the architecture, initialized randomly. We freeze all the parameters in the model except the video-specific ones (the aggregator and video cross-attention), and train them on the video pre-training data. We use the same training hyperparameters as the image annealing stage, with small differences in the learning rate. We uniformly sample 16 frames from the full video, and represent each frame using four chunks, each of size of 448 × 448 pixels. We use an aggregation factor of 16 in the video aggregator, hence obtaining one effective frame, which the text tokens cross-attend to. We use a global batch size of 4,096, a sequence length of 190 tokens, and a learning rate of 10−4 during training.

### 7.5 Post-Training

In this section, we describe the post-training recipe for our vision adapters. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model on highly curated multi-modal conversational data to enable chat capabilities. We further implement direct preference optimization (DPO) to boost human evaluation performance and rejection sampling to improve multi-modal reasoning capabilities. Finally, we add a quality-tuning stage where we continue finetuning the model on a very small set of high-quality conversational data which further boosts human evaluation while retaining performance across benchmarks. More details on each of these steps are provided below.

### 7.5.1 Supervised Finetuning Data

We describe our supervised finetuning (SFT) data for image and video capabilities separately below.

Image. We utilize a mix of different datasets for supervised finetuning.

- Academic datasets. We convert a highly filtered collection of existing academic datasets to questionanswer pairs using templates or via LLM rewriting. The LLM rewriting's purpose is to augment the data with different instructions and to improve the language quality of answers.
- Human annotations. We collect multi-modal conversation data via human annotators for a wide range of tasks (open-ended question-answering, captioning, practical use cases, etc.) and domains (e.g., natural images and structured images). Annotators are provided with images and asked to write conversations. To ensure diversity, we cluster large-scale datasets and sampled images uniformly across different clusters. Further, we acquire additional images for a few specific domains by expanding a seed via k-nearest

neighbors. Annotators are also provided with intermediate checkpoints of existing models to facilitate model-in-the-loop style annotations, so that model generations can be utilized as a starting point by the annotators to then provide additional human edits. This is an iterative process, in which model checkpoints would be regularly updated with better performing versions trained on the latest data. This increases the volume and efficiency of human annotations, while also improving their quality.

- Synthetic data. We explore different ways to generate synthetic multi-modal data by using textrepresentations of images and a text-input LLM. The high-level idea is to utilize the reasoning capabilities of text-input LLMs to generate question-answer pairs in the text domain, and replace the text representation with its corresponding images to produce synthetic multi-modal data. Examples include rendering texts from question-answer datasets as images or rendering table data into synthetic images of tables and charts. Additionally, we use captions and OCR extractions from existing images to generate additional conversational or question-answer data related to the images.
Video. Similar to the image adapter, we use academic datasets with pre-existing annotations and convert them into appropriate textual instructions and target responses. The targets are converted to open-ended responses or multiple-choice options, whichever is more appropriate. We ask humans to annotate videos with questions and corresponding answers. The annotators are asked to focus on questions that could not be answered based on a single frame, to steer the annotators towards questions that require temporal understanding.

#### 7.5.2 Supervised Finetuning Recipe

We describe our supervised finetuning (SFT) recipe for image and video capabilities separately below.

Image. We initialize from the pre-trained image adapter, but hot-swap the pre-trained language model's weights with the instruction tuned language model's weights. The language model weights are kept frozen to maintain text-only performance, i.e., we only update the vision encoder and image adapter weights.

Our approach to finetune the model is similar to Wortsman et al. (2022). First, we run a hyperparameter sweep using multiple random subsets of data, learning rates and weight decay values. Next, we rank the models based on their performance. Finally, we average the weights of the top-K models to obtain the final model. The value of K is determined by evaluating the averaged models and selecting the instance with highest performance. We observe that the averaged models consistently yield better results compared to the best individual model found via grid search. Further, this strategy reduces sensitivity to hyperparameters.

Video. For video SFT, we initialize the video aggregator and cross-attention layers using the pre-trained weights. The rest of the parameters in the model, the image weights and the LLM, are initialized from corresponding models following their finetuning stages. Similar to video pre-training, we then finetune only the video parameters on the video SFT data. For this stage, we increase the video length to 64 frames, and use an aggregation factor of 32 to get two effective frames. The resolution of the chunks is also increased to be consistent with the corresponding image hyperparameters.

#### 7.5.3 Preference Data

We built multimodal pair-wise preference datasets for reward modeling and direct preference optimization.

- Human annotations. The human-annotated preference data consists of comparisons between two different model outputs, labeled as "chosen" and "rejected", with 7-scale ratings. The models used to generate responses are sampled on-the-fly from a pool of the best recent models, each with different characteristics. We update the model pool weekly. Besides preference labels, we also request annotators to provide optional human edits to correct inaccuracies in "chosen" responses because vision tasks have a low tolerance for inaccuracies. Note that human editing is an optional step because there is a trade-off between volume and quality in practice.
- Synthetic data. Synthetic preference pairs could also be generated by using text-only LLMs to edit and deliberately introduce errors in the supervised finetuning dataset. We took the conversational data as input, and use an LLM to introduce subtle but meaningful errors (e.g., change objects, change attributes, add mistakes in calculations, etc.). These edited responses are used as negative "rejected" samples and paired with the "chosen" original supervised finetuning data.

- Rejection sampling. Furthermore, to create more on-policy negative samples, we leveraged the iterative process of rejection sampling to collect additional preference data. We discuss our usage of rejection sampling in more detail in the following sections. At a high-level, rejection sampling is used to iteratively sample high-quality generations from a model. Therefore, as a by-product, all generations that are not selected can be used as negative rejected samples and used as additional preference data pairs.
#### 7.5.4 Reward Modeling

We train a vision reward model (RM) on top of the vision SFT model and the language RM. The vision encoder and the cross-attention layers are initialized from the vision SFT model and unfrozen during training, while the self-attention layers are initialized from the language RM and kept frozen. We observe that freezing the language RM part generally leads to better accuracy, especially on tasks that require the RM to judge based on its knowledge or the language quality. We adopt the same training objective as the language RM, but adding a weighted regularization term on the square of the reward logits averaged over the batch, which prevents the reward scores from drifting.

The human preference annotations in Section 7.5.3 are used to train the vision RM. We follow the same practice as language preference data (Section 4.2.1) to create two or three pairs with clear ranking (edited > chosen > rejected). In addition, we also synthetically augment the negative responses by perturbing the words or phrases related to the information in the image (such as numbers or visual texts). This encourages the vision RM to ground its judgement based on the actual image content.

### 7.5.5 Direct Preference Optimization

Similar to the language model (Section 4.1.4), we further train the vision adapters with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al. (2023)) using the preference data described in Section 7.5.3. To combat the distribution shift during post-training rounds, we only keep recent batches of human preference annotations while dropping batches that are sufficiently off-policy (e.g., if the base pre-trained model is changed). We find that instead of always freezing the reference model, updating it in an exponential moving average (EMA) fashion every k-steps helps the model learn more from the data, resulting in better performance in human evaluations. Overall, we observed that the vision DPO model consistently performs better than its SFT starting point in human evaluations for every finetuning iteration.

#### 7.5.6 Rejection Sampling

Most available question-answer pairs only contain the final answer and lack the chain-of-thought explanation that is required to train a model that generalizes well for reasoning tasks. We use rejection sampling to generate the missing explanations for such examples and boost the model's reasoning capabilities.

Given a question-answer pair, we generate multiple answers by sampling the finetuned model with different system prompts or temperature. Next, we compare the generated answers to the ground-truth via heuristics or an LLM judge. Finally, we retrain the model by adding the correct answers back into the finetuning data mix. We find it useful to keep multiple correct answers per question.

To ensure we only add high-quality examples back into training, we implemented the following two guardrails. First, we find that some examples contain incorrect explanations, despite the final answer being correct. We observed that this pattern occurs more frequently for questions where only a small fraction of the generated answers is correct. Therefore, we drop answers for questions where the probability of the answer being correct is below a certain threshold. Second, raters prefer some answers over others due to differences in language or style. We use the reward model to select top-K highest-quality answers and add them back into training.

#### 7.5.7 Quality Tuning

We curate a small but highly selective SFT dataset where all samples have been rewritten and verified either by humans or our best models to meet our highest standards. We train DPO models with this data to improve response quality, calling the process Quality-Tuning (QT). We find that QT significantly improves human evaluations without affecting generalization verified by benchmarks when the QT dataset covers a wide range

of tasks and proper early stopping is applied. We select checkpoints at this stage purely based on benchmarks to ensure capabilities are retained or improved.

### 7.6 Image Recognition Results

We evaluate the performance of the image understanding capabilities of Llama 3 on a range of tasks spanning natural image understanding, text understanding, charts understanding and multimodal reasoning:

- MMMU (Yue et al., 2024a) is a challenging dataset for mulitmodal reasoning where model is expected to understand images and solve college-level problems spanning 30 different disciplines. This includes both multiple-choice and open ended questions. We evaluate our model on the validation set with 900 images, in line with other works.
- VQAv2 (Antol et al., 2015) tests the ability of a model to combine image understanding, language understanding and commonsense knowlege to answer generic questions about natural images
- AI2 Diagram (Kembhavi et al., 2016) evaluates models capability to parse scientific diagrams and answer questions about the same. We use the same evaluation protocol as Gemini and x.ai, and report scores using a transparent bounding box.
- ChartQA (Masry et al., 2022) is a challenging benchmark for charts understanding. This requires model to visually understand different kinds of charts and answer logical questions about the charts.
- TextVQA (Singh et al., 2019) is a popular benchmark dataset that requires models to read and reason about text in images to answer questions about them. This tests the OCR understanding ability of the model on natural images.
- DocVQA (Mathew et al., 2020) is a benchmark dataset focused on document analysis and recognition. It contains images of a wide range of documents which evaluates a model's ability to perform OCR understanding and reason about the contents of a document to answer questions about them.

Table 29 presents the results of our experiments. The results in the table show that our vision module attached to Llama 3 performs competitively across a wide range of image-recognition benchmarks at varying model capacities. Using the resulting Llama 3-V 405B model, we outperform GPT-4V on all benchmarks, while being slightly behind Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Llama 3 405B appears particularly competitive on document understanding tasks.

### 7.7 Video Recognition Results

We evaluate our video adapter for Llama 3 on three benchmarks:

- PerceptionTest (Pătrăucean et al., 2023) evaluates the model's ability to answer temporal reasoning questions focusing on skills (memory, abstraction, physics, semantics) and different types of reasoning (descriptive, explanatory, predictive, counterfactual). It consists of 11.6K test QA pairs, each with an on-average 23s long video, filmed by 100 participants worldwide to show perceptually interesting tasks. We focus on the multiple-choice question answering task, where each question is paired with

three possible options. We report performance on the held-out test split which is accessed by submitting our predictions to an online challenge server.16

- NExT-QA (Xiao et al., 2021) is another temporal and causal reasoning benchmark, with a focus on open-ended question answering. It consists of 1K test videos each on-average 44s in length, paired with 9K questions. The evaluation is performed by comparing the model's responses with the ground truth answer using Wu-Palmer Similarity (WUPS) (Wu and Palmer, 1994).17
- TVQA (Lei et al., 2018) evaluates the model's ability to perform compositional reasoning, requiring spatiotemporal localization of relevant moments, recognition of visual concepts, and joint reasoning with subtitle-based dialogue. This dataset, being derived from popular TV shows, additionally tests for the model's ability to leverage its outside-knowledge of those TV shows in answering the questions. It consists of over 15K validation QA pairs, with each corresponding video clip being on-average 76s in length. It also follows a multiple-choice format with five options for each question, and we report performance on the validation set following prior work (OpenAI, 2023b).
- ActivityNet-QA (Yu et al., 2019) evaluates the model's ability to reason over long video clips to understand actions, spatial relations, temporal relations, counting, etc. It consists of 8K test QA pairs from 800 videos, each on-average 3 minutes long. For evaluation, we follow the protocol from prior work (Google, 2023; Lin et al., 2023; Maaz et al., 2024), where the model generates short one-word or one-phrase answers, and the correctness of the output is evaluated using the GPT-3.5 API which compares it to the ground truth answer. We report the average accuracy as evaluated by the API.

When performing inference, we uniformly sample frames from the full video clip and pass those frames into the model with a short text prompt. Since most of our benchmarks involve answering multiple-choice questions, we use the following prompt: Select the correct answer from the following options: {question}. Answer with the correct option letter and nothing else. For benchmarks that require producing a short answer (e.g., ActivityNet-QA and NExT-QA), we use the following prompt: Answer the question using a single word or phrase. {question}. For NExT-QA, since the evaluation metric (WUPS) is sensitive to the length and the specific words used, we additionally prompt the model to be specific and respond with the most salient answer, for instance specifying "living room" instead of simply responding with "house" when asked a location question. For benchmarks that contain subtitles (i.e., TVQA), we include the subtitles corresponding to the clip in the prompt during inference.

We present the performance of Llama 3 8B and 70B in Table 30. We compare Llama 3's performance with that of two Gemini and two GPT-4 models. Note that all our results are zero-shot, as we do not include any part of these benchmarks in our training or finetuning data. We find that our Llama 3 models that train a small video adapter during post-training are very competitive, and in some cases even better, than other models that potentially leverage native multimodal processing all the way from pre-training. Llama 3 performs particularly well on video recognition given that we only evaluate the 8B and 70B parameter models. Llama 3 achieves its best performance on PerceptionTest, suggesting the model has a strong ability to perform complex temporal reasoning. On long-form activity understanding tasks like ActivityNet-QA, Llama 3 is able to obtain strong results even though it is processing only up to 64 frames, which means that for a 3-minute long video the model only processes one frame every 3 seconds.

### 8 Speech Experiments

We perform experiments to study a compositional approach of integrating speech capabilities into Llama 3, resembling the method we used for visual recognition. On the input side, an encoder, together with an adapter, is incorporated to process speech signals. We leverage a system prompt (in text) to enable different modes of operation for speech understanding in Llama 3. If no system prompt is provided, the model acts as a general-purpose spoken dialogue model which can effectively respond to the user speech in a manner that is consistent with the text-only version of Llama 3. The dialogue history is introduced as the prompt prefix to improve the multi-round dialogue experience. We also experiment with system prompts that enable the use of Llama 3 for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and automatic speech translation (AST). The speech interface of Llama 3 supports up to 34 languages.18 It also allows for the interleaved input of text and speech, enabling the model to solve advanced audio-comprehension tasks.

We also experiment with a speech generation approach in which we implement a streaming text-to-speech (TTS) system that generates speech waveforms on-the-fly during language model decoding. We design the speech generator for Llama 3 based on a proprietary TTS system and do not fine-tune the language model for speech generation. Instead, we focus on improving speech synthesis latency, accuracy, and naturalness by leveraging Llama 3 embeddings at inference time. The speech interface is illustrated in Figure 28 and 29.

#### 8.1 Data

#### 8.1.1 Speech Understanding

The training data can be categorized into two types. The pre-training data includes a large amount of unlabeled speech, which is used to initialize the speech encoder in a self-supervised manner. The supervised finetuning data includes speech recognition, speech translation, and spoken dialogue data; this data is used to unlock specific abilities when integrated with the large language model.

Pre-training data. To pre-train the speech encoder, we curate a dataset of approximately 15M hours of speech recordings encompassing a large number of languages. We filter our audio data using a voice activity detection (VAD) model and select audio samples with a VAD threshold above 0.7 for pre-training. In speech pre-training data, we also focus on ensuring the absence of PII. We use the Presidio Analyzer to identify such PII.

Speech recognition and translation data. Our ASR training data contains 230K hours of manually transcribed speech recordings that span 34 languages. Our AST training data contains 90K hours of translations in two directions: from 33 languages to English and from English to 33 languages. This data contains both supervised and synthetic data generated using the NLLB toolkit (NLLB Team et al., 2022). The use of synthetic AST data enables us to increase model quality for low-resource languages. The speech segments in our data have a maximum length of 60 seconds.

Spoken dialogue data. To finetune the speech adapter for spoken dialogue, we synthetically generate responses

<sup>18</sup>The speech interface supports the following 34 languages: Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Malayalam, Marathi, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Urdu, Vietnamese.

for speech prompts by asking the language model to respond to transcriptions of those prompts (Fathullah et al., 2024). We generate synthetic data this way using a subset of the ASR dataset with 60K hours of speech. In addition, we generate 25K hours of synthetic data by running the Voicebox TTS system (Le et al., 2024) on subsets of the data used to finetune Llama 3. We used several heuristics to select a subset of finetuning data that matches the distribution of speech. These heuristics include focusing on relatively short prompts with a simple structure and without non-text symbols.

#### 8.1.2 Speech Generation

The speech generation datasets mainly consist of those for training the text normalization (TN) model and the prosody model (PM). Both training data are augmented with an additional input feature of the Llama 3 embeddings to provide contextual information.

Text normalization data. Our TN training dataset includes 55K samples that cover a wide range of semiotic classes (e.g., number, date, time) that require non-trivial normalization. Each sample is a pair of written-form text and the corresponding normalized spoken-form text, with an inferred sequence of handcrafted TN rules that carry out the normalization.

Prosody model data. The PM training data includes linguistic and prosodic features extracted from a 50K-hour TTS dataset, which are paired transcripts and audios recorded by professional voice actors in studio settings.

Llama 3 embedding. The Llama 3 embeddings are taken as the output of the 16th decoder layer. We work exclusively with the Llama 3 8B model and extract the embeddings for a given text (i.e. written-form input text for TN or the audio transcript for PM) as if they are generated by the Llama 3 model with an empty user prompt. In a given sample, each chunk in the Llama 3 token sequence is explicitly aligned with the corresponding chunks in native input sequence for TN or PM, i.e., TN-specific text tokens (demarcated by unicode category) or phone-rate features respectively. This allows for training the TN and PM modules with streaming input of Llama 3 tokens and embeddings.

### 8.2 Model Architecture

### 8.2.1 Speech Understanding

On the input side, the speech module consists of two successive modules: a speech encoder and an adapter. The output of the speech module is directly fed into the language model as token representation, enabling direct interaction between speech and text tokens. Furthermore, we incorporate two new special tokens to enclose the sequence of speech representations. The speech module differs substantially from the vision module (see Section 7), which feeds multi-modal information into the language model via cross-attention layers. By contrast, the speech module generates embeddings that can be seamlessly integrated with text tokens, enabling the speech interface to leverage all the capabilities of the Llama 3 language model.

Speech encoder. Our speech encoder is a Conformer (Gulati et al., 2020) model with 1B parameters. The input to the model consists of 80-dimensional mel-spectrogram features, which are first processed by a stride-4 stacking layer followed by a linear projection to reduce the frame length to 40 ms. The resulting features are processed by an encoder with 24 Conformer layers. Each Conformer layer has a latent dimension of 1536, and consists of two Macron-net style feed-forward networks with dimension 4096, a convolution module with kernel size 7, and a rotary attention module (Su et al., 2024) with 24 attention heads.

Speech adapter. The speech adapter contains about 100M parameters. It is composed of a convolution layer, a rotary Transformer layer, and a linear layer. The convolution layer has a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 2, which is designed to reduce the speech frame length to 80ms. This allows the model to provide more coarse-grained features to the language model. The Transformer layer has a latent dimension of 3072 and a feed-forward network with a dimension of 4096 which further processes the information from speech with context after the convolutional downsampling. Finally, the linear layer maps the output dimension to match that of the language-model embedding layer.

#### 8.2.2 Speech Generation

We use Llama 3 8B embeddings in two key components for speech generation: Text Normalization and Prosody Modeling. The TN module ensures semantic correctness by contextually transforming written text into spoken form. The PM module enhances naturalness and expressiveness by predicting prosodic features using these embeddings. Together, they enable accurate and natural speech generation.

Text normalization. As a determinant of the semantic correctness of generated speech, the text normalization (TN) module carries out context-aware transformation from written-form text into the respective spoken form which is eventually verbalized by the downstream components. For example, the written-form text 123 is read as a cardinal number (one hundred twenty three) or spelled digit-by-digit (one two three) depending on the semantic context. The TN system consists of a streaming LSTM-based sequence-tagging model that predicts the sequence of handcrafted TN rules used to transform the input text (Kang et al., 2024). The neural model also takes in Llama 3 embeddings via cross attention to leverage the contextual information encoded therein, enabling minimal text token lookahead and streaming input/output.

Prosody modeling. To enhance the naturalness and expressiveness of synthesized speech, we integrate a decoder-only Transformer-based Prosody model (PM) (Radford et al., 2021) that takes the Llama 3 embeddings as an additional input. This integration leverages the linguistic capabilities of Llama 3, utilizing both its textual output and intermediate embeddings at the token rate (Devlin et al., 2018; Dong et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2023) to enhance the prediction of prosody features, thus reducing the lookahead required by the model.

The PM integrates several input components to generate comprehensive prosody predictions: linguistic features derived from the text normalization front-end detailed above, tokens, and embeddings. The PM predicts three key prosodic features: log duration of each phone, log F0 (fundamental frequency) average, and log power average across the phone duration. The model comprises a uni-directional Transformer and six attention heads. Each block includes cross-attention layers and dual fully connected layers with a hidden dimension of 864. A distinctive feature of the PM is its dual cross-attention mechanism, with one layer dedicated to linguistic inputs and the other to Llama embeddings. This setup efficiently manages varying input rates without requiring explicit alignment.

### 8.3 Training Recipe

### 8.3.1 Speech Understanding

Training of the speech module is done in two stages. The first stage, speech pre-training, leverages unlabeled data to train a speech encoder that exhibits strong generalization capabilities across languages and acoustic conditions. In the second stage, supervised fine-tuning, the adapter and pre-trained encoder are integrated with the language model, and trained jointly with it while the LLM stays frozen. This enables the model to respond to speech input. This stage uses labeled data corresponding to speech understanding abilities.

Multilingual ASR and AST modeling often results in language confusion/interference, which leads to degraded performance. A popular way to mitigate this is to incorporate language identification (LID) information, both on the source and target side. This can lead to improved performance in the predetermined set of directions, but it does come with potential loss of generality. For instance, if a translation system expects LID on both source and target side, then the model will not likely to show good zero-shot performance in directions that were not seen in training. So our challenge is to design a system that allows LID information to some extent, but keeps the model general enough such that we can have the model do speech translation in unseen directions. To address this, we design system prompts which only contain LID for the text to be emitted (target side). There is no LID information for the speech input (source side) in these prompts, which also potentially allows it to work with code-switched speech. For ASR, we use the following system prompt: Repeat after me in {language}:, where {language} comes from one of the 34 languages (English, French, etc.) For speech translation, the system prompt is: Translate the following sentence into {language}:. This design has been shown to be effective in prompting the language model to respond in the desired language. We used the same system prompts during training and inference.

Speech pre-training. We use the self-supervised BEST-RQ algorithm (Chiu et al., 2022) to pre-train the speech

encoder. We apply a mask of 32-frame length with a probability of 2.5% to the input mel-spectrogram. If the speech utterances are longer than 60 seconds, we perform a random crop of 6K frames, corresponding to 60 seconds of speech. We quantize mel-spectrogram features by stacking 4 consecutive frames, projecting the 320-dimensional vectors to a 16-dimensional space, and performing a nearest-neighbor search with respect to cosine similarity metric within a codebook of 8,192 vectors. To stabilize pre-training, we employ 16 different codebooks. The projection matrix and codebooks are randomly initialized and are not updated throughout the model training. The multi-softmax loss is used only on masked frames for efficiency reasons. The encoder is trained for 500K steps with a global batch size of 2,048 utterances.

Supervised finetuning. Both the pre-trained speech encoder and the randomly initialized adapter are further jointly optimized with Llama 3 in the supervised finetuning stage. The language model remains unchanged during this process. The training data is a mixture of ASR, AST, and spoken dialogue data. The speech model for Llama 3 8B is trained for 650K updates, using a global batch size of 512 utterances and an initial learning rate of 10−4 . The speech model for Llama 3 70B is trained for 600K updates, using a global batch size of 768 utterances and an initial learning rate of 4 × 10−5 .

#### 8.3.2 Speech Generation

To support real-time processing, the prosody model employs a lookahead mechanism that considers a fixed number of future phones and a variable number of future tokens. This ensures consistent lookahead while processing incoming text, which is crucial for low-latency speech synthesis applications.

Training. We develop a dynamic alignment strategy utilizing causal masking to facilitate streamability in speech synthesis. This strategy incorporates a lookahead mechanism for a fixed number of future phones and a variable number of future tokens, aligning with the chunking process during text normalization (Section 8.1.2). For each phone, the token lookahead includes the maximum number of tokens defined by the chunk size, resulting in variable lookahead for Llama embeddings but fixed lookahead for phonemes.

The Llama 3 embeddings are sourced from the Llama 3 8B model, which remains frozen during the training of the Prosody Model. The input phone-rate features include both linguistic and speaker/style controllability elements. The model training is conducted with a batch size of 1,024 utterances, each with a maximum length of 500 phones. We employ a learning rate of 9 × 10−4 using the AdamW optimizer, training over 1 million updates with a learning rate warmup for the first 3,000 updates, following a cosine schedule.

Inference. During inference, the same lookahead mechanism and causal masking strategy are employed to ensure consistency between training and real-time processing. The PM handles incoming text in a streaming manner, updating the input phone by phone for phone-rate features and chunk by chunk for token-rate features. The new chunk input is updated only when the first phone for that chunk is current, maintaining the alignment and lookahead as during training.

For prosody target prediction, we employ a delayed pattern approach (Kharitonov et al., 2021), which enhances the model's ability to capture and reproduce long-range prosodic dependencies. This approach contributes to the naturalness and expressiveness of the synthesized speech, ensuring low-latency and high-quality output.

### 8.4 Speech Understanding Results

We evaluate the speech understanding capabilities of our speech interface for Llama 3 on three tasks: (1) automatic speech recognition, (2) speech translation, and (3) spoken question answering. We compare the performance of our speech interface for Llama 3 with three state-of-the-art models for speech understanding: Whisper (Radford et al., 2023), SeamlessM4T (Barrault et al., 2023), and Gemini.19 In all the evaluations, we used greedy search for Llama 3 token prediction.

Speech recognition. We evaluate the ASR performance on the English datasets of Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS; Pratap et al. (2020)), LibriSpeech (Panayotov et al., 2015), VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021a), and a subset of the multilingual FLEURS dataset (Conneau et al., 2023). In evaluation, the decoding results are post-processed using the Whisper text normalizer to ensure consistency in comparing with the reported results of other models. On all benchmarks, we measure the word error rate of our speech interface for Llama 3

<sup>19</sup>Due to technical limitations, we compare with the performance of Gemini on MLS reported in the original paper.

on the standard test set of those benchmarks, except for Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Thai, where the character error rate is reported.

Table 31 shows the results of ASR evaluations. It demonstrates the strong performance of Llama 3 (and multi-modal foundation models more generally) on speech recognition tasks: our model outperforms models that are tailored to speech like Whisper20 and SeamlessM4T on all benchmarks. On MLS English, Llama 3 performs similarly to Gemini.

Speech translation. We also evaluate our models on speech translation tasks in which the model is asked to translate non-English speech into English text. We use the FLEURS and Covost 2 (Wang et al., 2021b) datasets in these evaluations, measuring BLEU scores of the translated English. Table 32 presents the results of these experiments.21 The performance of our models in speech translation highlights the advantages of multimodal foundation models for tasks such as speech translation.

Spoken question answering. The speech interface of Llama 3 demonstrates remarkable question answering capabilities. The model can effortlessly comprehend code-switched speech without any prior exposure to such data. Notably, although the model was trained only on single-turn dialogue, it is capable of engaging in extended, coherent multi-turn dialogue sessions. Figure 30 presents a few examples that highlight these multilingual and multi-turn capabilities.

Safety. We evaluate the safety of our speech model on MuTox (Costa-jussà et al., 2023), a multilingual audio-based dataset of 20,000 utterances for English and Spanish and 4,000 for 19 other languages, each with toxicity labels attached. The audio is passed as input to the model and the output is evaluated for toxicity, after cleaning some special characters. We apply the MuTox classifier (Costa-jussà et al., 2023) and compare the results with Gemini 1.5 Pro. We evaluate the percentage of added toxicity (AT), when the input prompt is safe and the output is toxic, and the percentage of lost toxicity (LT), when the input prompt is toxic and the answer is safe. Table 33 shows the results for English and an average across all 21 languages that we evaluated on.22 The percentage of added toxicity is very low: our speech models have the lowest percentage of added toxicity for English, with less than 1%. It removes significantly more toxicity than it adds.

### 8.5 Speech Generation Results

For speech generation, we focus on evaluating the quality of token-wise input streaming models with the Llama 3 embeddings for the text normalization and prosody modeling tasks. The evaluation focuses on

<sup>20</sup>On FLEURS ASR, Malayalam is not officially reported for Whisper v3, so we use the average of 33 languages.

<sup>21</sup>On Covost 2, we evaluate only on 15 (out of 21) languages.

<sup>22</sup>Note that for Gemini, we encountered that a significant number of responses were empty, which could be due to safety filters on their side (though some empty responses were for non-toxic input) or to rate limits. To conduct the analysis, we assumed that all the empty responses are safe. This is the most conservative approach for results and the upper bound of what Gemini results would look like.

comparisons with models that do not take the Llama 3 embeddings as an additional input.

Text normalization. To measure the effect of Llama 3 embeddings, we experimented with changing the amount of right context the model uses. We trained the model using a right context of 3 TN tokens (demarcated by unicode category). This model is compared to models that do not use the Llama 3 embeddings, using a 3-token right context or a full bi-directional context. As expected, Table 34 shows using the full right context improves performance for the model without Llama 3 embeddings. However, the model that incorporates the Llama 3 embeddings outperforms all other models, hence enabling token-rate input/output streaming without relying on long context in the input.

Prosody modeling. To evaluate the performance of the our prosody model (PM) with Llama 3 8B, we conducted two sets of human evaluation comparing models with and without Llama 3 embeddings. Raters listened to samples from different models and indicated their preferences. To generate the final speech waveform, we use an inhouse transformer based acoustic model (Wu et al., 2021) that predicts spectral features and a WaveRNN neural vocoder (Kalchbrenner et al., 2018) to generate the final speech waveform.

| Model | Context | Accuracy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Without Llama 3 8B | 3 | 73.6% |
| Without Llama 3 8B | ∞ | 88.0% |
| With Llama 3 8B | 3 | 90.7% |

Table 34 Sample-wise text normalization (TN) accuracy. We compare models with or without Llama 3 8B embeddings, and using different right-context values.

First, we compare directly to a streaming baseline model without Llama 3 embeddings. In the second test, the Llama 3 8B PM is compared to a non-streaming baseline model without Llama 3 embeddings. As shown in Table 35, the Llama 3 8B PM is preferred 60% of the time compared to the streaming baseline, and

| Model | Preference | Model | Preference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PM for Llama 3 8B | 60.0% | PM for Llama 3 8B | 63.6% |
| Streaming phone-only baseline | 40.0% | Non-streaming phone-only baseline | 36.4% |

Table 35 Prosody Modeling (PM) evaluation. Left: Rater preferences of PM for Llama 3 8B vs. streaming phone-only baseline. Right: Rater preferences of PM for Llama 3 8B vs. non-streaming phone-only baseline.

63.6% of the time compared to the non-streaming baseline, indicating a significant improvement in perceived quality. The key advantage of the Llama 3 8B PM is its token-wise streaming capability (Section 8.2.2), which maintains low latency during inference. This reduces the model's lookahead requirements, enabling more responsive and real-time speech synthesis compared to non-streaming baselines. Overall, the Llama 3 8B prosody model consistently outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the naturalness and expressiveness of synthesized speech.

### 9 Related Work

The development of Llama 3 builds on a large body of prior work studying foundation models for language, images, videos, and speech. A comprehensive overview of that work is outside the scope of this paper; we refer the reader to Bordes et al. (2024); Madan et al. (2024); Zhao et al. (2023a) for such overviews. Below, we briefly outline seminal works that directly influenced the development of Llama 3.

#### 9.1 Language

Scale. Llama 3 follows the enduring trend of applying straightforward methods at ever increasing scales in foundation models. Improvements are driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model using almost fifty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing 405B parameters, our largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as PALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022). Little is publicly known about the size of other frontier models, such as Claude 3 or GPT 4 (OpenAI, 2023a), but overall performance is compareable.

Small models. Developments in smaller models have paralleled those in large models. Models with fewer parameters can dramatically improve inference cost and simplify deployment (Mehta et al., 2024; Team et al., 2024). The smaller Llama 3 models achieve this by training far beyond the point of compute optimal training, effectively trading training compute for inference efficiency. An alternative path is to distill larger models into smaller ones, as in Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).

Architectures. While Llama 3 makes minimal architectural modifiations to compared to Llama 2, other recent foundation models have explored other designs. Most notably, mixture of experts architectures (Shazeer et al., 2017; Lewis et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) can be used as an efficient way to increase the capacity of a models, such as in Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024) and Arctic (Snowflake, 2024). Llama 3 outperforms these models, suggesting that dense architectures are not the limiting factor, but there remain numerous trade offs in terms of training and inference efficiency, and model stability at scale.

Open source. Open weights foundation models have rapidly improved over the last year, with Llama3-405B now competitive with the current closed weight state-of-the-art. Numerous model families have recently been developed, including Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023), MPT (Databricks, 2024), Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023), Arctic (Snowflake, 2024), OpenELM (Mehta et al., 2024), OLMo (Groeneveld et al., 2024), StableLM (Bellagente et al., 2024), OpenLLaMA (Geng and Liu, 2023), Qwen (Bai et al., 2023), Gemma (Team et al., 2024), Grok (XAI, 2024), and Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).

Post-training. Post-training Llama 3 follows the established strategy of instruction tuning (Chung et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022) followed by alignment with human feedback (Kaufmann et al., 2023). While some studies have shown the surprising effectiveness of lightweight alignment procedures (Zhou et al., 2024), Llama 3 uses millions of human instructions and preference judgments to improve the pre-trained model, including

techniques such as rejection sampling (Bai et al., 2022), supervised finetuning (Sanh et al., 2022), and Direct Preference Optimization (Rafailov et al., 2023). In order to curate these instruction and preference examples, we deploy earlier versions of Llama 3 to filter (Liu et al., 2024c), re-write (Pan et al., 2024), or generate prompts and responses (Liu et al., 2024b) and apply these techniques through multiple rounds of post-training.

### 9.2 Multimodality

Our experiments with multimodal capabilities for Llama 3 are part of a long line of work on foundation models that jointly model multiple modalities.

Images. A substantial body of work has trained image-recognition models on large amounts of image-text pairs, for example, Mahajan et al. (2018); Xiao et al. (2024a); Team (2024); OpenAI (2023b). Radford et al. (2021) presented one of the first models to jointly embed images and text via contrastive learning. More recently, a series of models has studied approaches similar to the one used in Llama 3, for example, Alayrac et al. (2022); Dai et al. (2023); Liu et al. (2023c,b); Yang et al. (2023b); Ye et al. (2023); Zhu et al. (2023). Our approach in Llama 3 combines ideas from many of these papers to achieve results that are comparable with Gemini 1.0 Ultra (Google, 2023) and GPT-4 Vision (OpenAI, 2023b); see Section 7.6.

Video. Although video inputs are supported by an increasing number of foundation models (Google, 2023; OpenAI, 2023b), the body of work on joint modeling of videos and language is not that large. Akin to Llama 3, most current studies adopt an adapter approach to align video and language representations and unlock question-answering and reasoning about videos (Lin et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a; Maaz et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2022). We find that such approaches produce results that are competitive with the state-of-the-art; see Section 7.7.

Speech. Our work also fits in a larger body of work combining language and speech modeling. Earlier joint models of text and speech include AudioPaLM (Rubenstein et al., 2023), VioLA (Wang et al., 2023b), VoxtLM Maiti et al. (2023), SUTLM (Chou et al., 2023), and Spirit-LM (Nguyen et al., 2024). Our work builds on prior compositional approaches to combining speech and language like Fathullah et al. (2024). Unlike most prior work, we opt to not finetune the language model itself for speech tasks as doing so may lead to contention on non-speech tasks. We find that at larger model scales, strong performances are attainable even without such finetuning; see Section 8.4.

## 10 Conclusion

In many ways, the development of high-quality foundation models is still in its infancy. Our experience in developing Llama 3 suggests that substantial further improvements of these models are on the horizon. Throughout the development of the Llama 3 model family, we found that a strong focus on high-quality data, scale, and simplicity consistently yielded the best results. In preliminary experiments, we explored more complex model architectures and training recipes but did not find the benefits of such approaches to outweigh the additional complexity they introduce in model development.

Developing a flagship foundation model such as Llama 3 involves overcoming a plethora of deep technical problems but also requires clever organizational decisions. For example, to ensure Llama 3 is not accidentally overfitted on commonly used benchmarks, our pre-training data was procured and processed by a separate team that was strongly incentivized to prevent contamination of that pre-training data with external benchmarks. As another example, we ensure that our human evaluations remain trustworthy by allowing only a small set of researchers who do not contribute to model development to perform and access these evaluations. While such organizational decisions are rarely discussed in technical papers, we found them to be pivotal to the successful development of the Llama 3 family of models.

We shared the details of our development process because we believe this will: (1) help the larger research community understand the key factors of foundation model development and (2) contribute to a more informed debate about the future of foundation models in the general public. We also shared preliminary experiments with integrating multimodal capabilities into Llama 3. While these models are still under active development and not yet ready for release, we hope sharing our results early will accelerate research in this direction.

Following the positive outcomes of the detailed safety analyses presented in this paper, we publicly release our Llama 3 language models in order to accelerate the development of AI systems for a plethora of societally relevant use cases and enable the research community to scrutinize our models and identify ways to make these models better and safer. We believe that the public release of foundation models plays a key role in the responsible development of such models, and we hope that the release of Llama 3 encourages the industry to embrace the open, responsible development of AGI.

## Abstract

*Efficient neural network backbones for mobile devices are often optimized for metrics such as FLOPs or parameter count. However, these metrics may not correlate well with latency of the network when deployed on a mobile device. Therefore, we perform extensive analysis of different metrics by deploying several mobile-friendly networks on a mobile device. We identify and analyze architectural and optimization bottlenecks in recent efficient neural networks and provide ways to mitigate these bottlenecks. To this end, we design an efficient backbone MobileOne, with variants achieving an inference time under 1 ms on an iPhone12 with 75.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. We show that MobileOne achieves state-of-the-art performance within the efficient architectures while being many times faster on mobile. Our best model obtains similar performance on ImageNet as MobileFormer while being 38*× *faster. Our model obtains 2.3% better top-1 accuracy on ImageNet than EfficientNet at similar latency. Furthermore, we show that our model generalizes to multiple tasks – image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation with significant improvements in latency and accuracy as compared to existing efficient architectures when deployed on a mobile device. Code and models are available at* https: //github.com/apple/ml-mobileone

### 1. Introduction

Design and deployment of efficient deep learning architectures for mobile devices has seen a lot of progress [5, 30,31,43,45,47] with consistently decreasing floating-point operations (FLOPs) and parameter count while improving accuracy. However, these metrics may not correlate well with the efficiency [9] of the models in terms of latency. Efficiency metric like FLOPs do not account for memory access cost and degree of parallelism, which can have a nontrivial effect on latency during inference [43]. Parameter count is also not well correlated with latency. For example, sharing parameters leads to higher FLOPS but smaller model size. Furthermore, parameter-less operations like skip-connections [24] or branching [33,50] can incur significant memory access costs. This disconnect can get exacerbated when custom accelerators are available in the regime of efficient architectures.

Our goal is to improve the latency cost of efficient architectures while improving their accuracy by identifying key architectural and optimization bottlenecks that affect ondevice latency. To identify architectural bottlenecks, we deploy neural networks on an iPhone12 by using CoreML [57] and benchmark their latency costs. To alleviate optimization bottlenecks, we decouple train-time and inferencetime architectures, i.e. using a linearly over-parameterized model at train-time and re-parameterizing the linear structures at inference [11–13]. We further alleviate optimization bottleneck by dynamically relaxing regularization throughout training to prevent the already small models from being over-regularized.

Based on our findings on the key bottlenecks, we design a novel architecture *MobileOne*, variants of which run under 1 ms on an iPhone12 achieving state-of-the-art accuracy within efficient architecture family while being significantly faster on the device. Like prior works on structural re-parameterization [11–13], MobileOne introduces linear branches at train-time which get re-parameterized at inference. However, a key difference between our model and prior structural re-parameterization works is the introduction of trivial over-parameterization branches, which provides further improvements in low parameter regime and model scaling strategy. At inference, our model has simple feed-forward structure without any branches or skipconnections. Since this structure incurs lower memory access cost, we can incorporate wider layers in our network which boosts representation capacity as demonstrated empirically in Table 9. For example, MobileOne-S1 has 4.8M parameters and incurs a latency of 0.89ms, while MobileNet-V2 [47] has 3.4M (29.2% less than MobileOne-S1) parameters and incurs a latency of 0.98ms. At this operating point, MobileOne attains 3.9% better top-1 accuracy than MobileNet-V2.

Figure 1. We show comparisons of Top-1 accuracy on image classification vs latency on an iPhone 12 (a), and zoomed out area (b) to include recent transformer architectures. We show mAP on object detection vs Top-1 accuracy on image classification in (c) with size of the marker indicating latency of the backbone on iPhone 12. Our models have significantly smaller latency compared to related works. Please refer to supp. mat. for higher resolution figures.

MobileOne achieves significant improvements in latency compared to efficient models in literature while maintaining the accuracy on several tasks – image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. As shown in Figure 6, MobileOne performs better than MobileViT-S [45] while being 5 × faster on image classification. As compared to EfficientNet-B0 [54], we achieve 2.3% better top-1 accuracy on ImageNet [10] with similar latency costs (see Figure 5). Furthermore, as seen in Figure 7, MobileOne models not only perform well on ImageNet, they also generalize to other tasks like object detection. Models like MobileNetV3- L [30] and MixNet-S [55] improve over MobileNetV2 on ImageNet, but those improvements do not translate to object detection task. As shown in Figure 7, MobileOne shows better generalization across tasks. For object detection on MS-COCO [37], best variant of MobileOne outperforms best variant MobileViT by 6.1% and MNASNet by 27.8%. For semantic segmentation, on PascalVOC [16] dataset, best variant of MobileOne outperforms best variant MobileViT by 1.3% and on ADE20K [65] dataset, best variant of MobileOne outperforms MobileNetV2 by 12.0%. In summary, our contributions are as follows:

- We introduce *MobileOne*, a novel architecture that
runs within 1 ms on a mobile device and achieves stateof-the-art accuracy on image classification within efficient model architectures. The performance of our model also generalizes to a desktop CPU and GPU.

- We analyze performance bottlenecks in activations and branching that incur high latency costs on mobile in recent efficient networks.
- We analyze the effects of train-time re-parameterizable branches and dynamic relaxation of regularization in training. In combination, they help alleviating optimization bottlenecks encountered when training small models.
- We show that our model generalizes well to other tasks – object detection and semantic segmentation while outperforming recent state-of-the-art efficient models.

We will release our trained networks and code for research purposes. We will also release the code for iOS application to enable benchmarking of networks on iPhone.

### 2. Related Work

Designing a real-time efficient neural network involves a trade-off between accuracy and performance. Earlier methods like SqueezeNet [34] and more recently Mobile-ViT [45], optimize for parameter count and a vast majority of methods like MobileNets [31, 47], MobileNeXt [66], ShuffleNet-V1 [64], GhostNet [20], MixNet [55] focus on optimizing for the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). EfficientNet [54] and TinyNet [21] study the compound scaling of depth, width and resolution while optimizing FLOPs. Few methods like MNASNet [53], MobileNetV3 [30] and ShuffleNet-V2 [43] optimize directly for latency. Dehghani et al. [9] show that FLOPs and parameter count are not well correlated with latency. Therefore, our work focuses on improving on-device latency while improving the accuracy.

Recently, ViT [14] and ViT-like architectures [58] have shown state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet dataset. Different designs like ViT-C [62], CvT [61], BoTNet [49], ConViT [8] and PiT [29] have been explored to incorporate biases using convolutions in ViT. More recently, MobileFormer [5] and MobileViT [45] were introduced to get ViT-like performance on a mobile platform. MobileViT optimizes for parameter count and MobileFormer optimizes for FLOPs and outperforms efficient CNNs in low FLOP regime. However, as we show in subsequent sections that low FLOPs does not necessarily result in low latency. We study key design choices made by these methods and their impact on latency.

Recent methods also introduce new architecture designs and custom layers to improve accuracy for mobile backbones. MobileNet-V3 [30], introduces an optimized activation function – Hard-Swish for a specific platform. However, scaling such functions to different platforms may be difficult.

Therefore, our design uses basic operators that are already available across different platforms. Expand-Nets [19], ACNet [11] and DBBNet [12], propose a dropin replacement for a regular convolution layer in recent CNN architectures and show improvements in accuracy. RepVGG [13] introduces re-parameterizable skip connections which is beneficial to train VGG-like model to better performance. These architectures have linear branches at train-time that get re-parameterized to simpler blocks at inference. We build on these re-parametrization works and introduce trivial over-parameterization branches thereby providing further improvements in accuracy.

### 3. Method

In this section, we analyse the correlation of popular metrics – FLOPs and parameter count – with latency on a mobile device. We also evaluate how different design

|  |  | FLOPs |  | Parameters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Type | corr. | p-value | corr. | p-value |
| Mobile Latency | 0.47 | 0.03 | 0.30 | 0.18 |
| CPU Latency | 0.06 | 0.80 | 0.07 | 0.77 |

choices in architectures effect the latency on the phone. Based on the evaluation, we describe our architecture and training algorithm.

#### 3.1. Metric Correlations

The most commonly used cost indicators for comparing the size of two or more models are parameter count and FLOPs [9]. However, they may not be well correlated with latency in real-world mobile applications. Therefore, we study the correlation of latency with FLOPS and parameter count for benchmarking efficient neural networks. We consider recent models and use their Pytorch implementation to convert them into ONNX format [2]. We convert each of these models to coreml packages using Core ML Tools [57]. We then develop an iOS application to measure the latency of the models on an iPhone12.

We plot latency vs. FLOPs and latency vs. parameter count as shown in Figure 2. We observe that many models with higher parameter count can have lower latency. We observe a similar plot between FLOPs and latency. Furthermore, we note the convolutional models such as MobileNets [43, 47, 56] have lower latency for similar FLOPs and parameter count than their transformer counterparts [5,45,58]. We also estimate the Spearman rank correlation [63] in Table 1a. We find that latency is moderately correlated with FLOPs and weakly correlated with parameter counts for efficient architectures on a mobile device. This correlation is even lower on a desktop CPU.

### 3.2. Key Bottlenecks

Activation Functions To analyze the effect of activation functions on latency, we construct a 30 layer convolutional neural network and benchmark it on iPhone12 using different activation functions, commonly used in efficient CNN backbones. All models in Table 2 have the same architecture except for activations, but their latencies are drastically different. This can be attributed to synchronization costs mostly incurred by recently introduced activation functions like SE-ReLU [32], Dynamic Shift-Max [36] and DynamicReLUs [6]. DynamicReLU and Dynamic Shift-Max have shown significant accuracy improvement in extremely low FLOP models like MicroNet [36], but, the latency cost of using these activations can be significant. Therefore we use only ReLU activations in MobileOne.

Figure 2. Top: FLOPs vs Latency on iPhone12. Bottom: Parameter Count vs Latency on iPhone 12. We indicate some networks using numbers as shown in the table above.

| Activation Function | Latency (ms) |
| --- | --- |
| ReLU [1] | 1.53 |
| GELU [27] | 1.63 |
| SE-ReLU [32] | 2.10 |
| SiLU [15] | 2.54 |
| Dynamic Shift-Max [36] | 57.04 |
| DynamicReLU-A [6] | 273.49 |
| DynamicReLU-B [6] | 242.14 |

Table 2. Comparison of latency on mobile device of different activation functions in a 30-layer convolutional neural network.

Architectural Blocks Two of the key factors that affect runtime performance are memory access cost and degree of parallelism [43]. Memory access cost increases significantly in multi-branch architectures as activations from each branch have to be stored to compute the next tensor in the graph. Such memory bottlenecks can be avoided if the network has smaller number of branches. Architectural

| Architectural |  | + Squeeze | + Skip |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Blocks | Baseline | Excite [32] | Connections [23] |
| Latency (ms) | 1.53 | 2.10 | 2.62 |

Table 3. Ablation on latency of different architectural blocks in a 30-layer convolutional neural network.

blocks that force synchronization like global pooling operations used in Squeeze-Excite block [32] also affect overall run-time due to synchronization costs. To demonstrate the hidden costs like memory access cost and synchronization cost, we ablate over using skip connections and squeezeexcite blocks in a 30 layer convolutional neural network. In Table 3b, we show how each of these choices contribute towards latency. Therefore we adopt an architecture with no branches at inference, which results in smaller memory access cost. In addition, we limit the use of Squeeze-Excite blocks to our biggest variant in order to improve accuracy.

#### 3.3. MobileOne Architecture

Based on the our evaluations of different design choices, we develop the architecture of MobileOne. Like prior works on structural re-parameterization [11–13,19], the train-time and inference time architecture of MobileOne is different. In this section, we introduce the basic block of MobileOne and the model scaling strategy used to build the network.

MobileOne Block MobileOne blocks are similar to blocks introduced in [11–13, 19], except that our blocks are designed for convolutional layers that are factorized into depthwise and pointwise layers. Furthermore, we introduce trivial over-parameterization branches which provide further accuracy gains. Our basic block builds on the MobileNet-V1 [31] block of 3x3 depthwise convolution followed by 1x1 pointwise convolutions. We then introduce reparameterizable skip connection [13] with batchnorm along with branches that replicate the structure as shown in Figure 3. The trivial over-parameterization factor k is a hyperparameter which is varied from 1 to 5. We ablate over the choice for k in Table 4. At inference, MobileOne model does not have any branches. They are removed using the re-parameterization process described in [12, 13].

For a convolutional layer of kernel size K, input channel dimension Cin and output channel dimension Cout, the weight matrix is denoted as W′ ∈ R Cout×Cin×K×K and bias is denoted as b ′ ∈ R D. A batchnorm layer contains accumulated mean µ, accumulated standard deviation σ, scale γ and bias β. Since convolution and batchnorm at inference are linear operations, they can be folded into a single convolution layer with weights Wc = W′ ∗ γ σ and bias bb = (b ′ − µ) ∗ γ σ + β. Batchnorm is folded into preceding convolutional layer in all the branches. For skip

Figure 3. MobileOne block has two different structures at train time and test time. Left: Train time MobileOne block with reparameterizable branches. Right: MobileOne block at inference where the branches are reparameterized. Either ReLU or SE-ReLU is used as activation. The trivial over-parameterization factor k is a hyperparameter which is tuned for every variant.

connection the batchnorm is folded to a convolutional layer with identity 1x1 kernel, which is then padded by K − 1 zeros as described in [13]. After obtaining the batchnorm folded weights in each branch, the weights W = PM i Wci and bias b = PM i bbi for convolution layer at inference is obtained, where M is the number of branches.

| MobileOne-S1 | 75.9 | 75.7 | 75.6 | 75.6 | 75.2 |

Table 6. Comparison of Top-1 on ImageNet for various values of trivial over-parameterization factor k.

To better understand the improvements from using train time re-parameterizable branches, we ablate over versions of MobileOne models by removing train-time reparameterizable branches (see Table 5), while keeping all other training parameters the same as described in Section 4. Using re-parameterizable branches significantly improves performance. To understand the importance of trivial over-parameterization branches, we ablate over the choice of over-parameterization factor k in Table 6. For larger variants of MobileOne, the improvements from trivial overparameterization starts diminishing. For smaller variant like MobileOne-S0, we see improvements of 0.5% by using trivial over-parameterization branches. In Figure 4, we see that adding re-parameterizable branches improves optimization as both train and validation losses are further lowered.

Model Scaling Recent works scale model dimensions like width, depth, and resolution to improve performance [22, 54]. MobileOne has similar depth scaling as MobileNet-V2, i.e. using shallower early stages where input resolution is larger as these layers are significantly slower compared to later stages which operate on smaller input resolution. We introduce 5 different width scales as seen in Table 7. Furthermore, we do not explore scaling up of input resolution as both FLOPs and memory consumption increase, which is detrimental to runtime performance on a mobile device. As our model does not have a multibranched architecture at inference, it does not incur data movement costs as discussed in previous sections. This enables us to aggressively scale model parameters compared to competing multi-branched architectures like MobileNet-V2, EfficientNets, etc. without incurring significant latency cost. The increased parameter count enables our models to generalize well to other computer vision tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation (see Section 4). In Table 4, we compare against recent train time over-parameterization works [11–13, 19] and show that MobileOne-S1 variant outperforms RepVGG-B0 which is ∼3× bigger.

#### 3.4. Training

As opposed to large models, small models need less regularization to combat overfitting. It is important to have weight decay in early stages of training as demonstrated

| Stage | Input | # Blocks | Stride | Block Type | # Channels |  |  | MobileOne Block Parameters (α, k, act=ReLU) |  |  |

Figure 4. Plot of train and validation losses of MobileOne-S0 model. From no branches to adding re-parameterizable branches with k=1, leads to 3.4% lower train loss. Adding more branches (k=4) lowers train loss by an additional ∼1%. From no branches to the variant with re-parameterizable branches (k=4), validation loss improves by 3.1%

empirically by [18]. Instead of completely removing weight decay regularization as studied in [18], we find that annealing the loss incurred by weight decay regularization over the course of training is more effective. In all our experiments, we use cosine schedule [42] for learning rate. Further, we use the same schedule to anneal weight decay coefficient. We also use the progressive learning curriculum introduced in [56]. In Table 8, we ablate over the various train settings keeping all other parameters fixed. We see that annealing the weight decay coefficient gives a 0.5% improvement.

#### 3.5. Benchmarking

Getting accurate latency measurements on a mobile device can be difficult. On the iPhone 12, there is no command line access or functionality to reserve all of a compute fabric for just the model execution. We also do not have access to the breakdown of the round-trip-latency into categories like the network initialization, data movement, and network execution. To measure latency, we developed an iOS application using swift [35]. The application runs the models using Core ML [57]. To eliminate startup inconsistencies, the model graph is loaded, the input tensor is preallocated, and the model is run once before benchmarking begins. During benchmarking, the app runs the model many times (default is 1000) and statistic are accumulated. To achieve lowest latency and highest consistency, all other applications on the phone are closed. For the models latency seen in Table 9, we report the full round-trip latency. A large fraction of this time may be from platform processes that are not model execution, but in a real application these delays may be unavoidable. Therefore we chose to include them in the reported latency. In order to filter out interrupts from other processes, we report the minimum latency for all the models. For CPU latency, we run the models on an Ubuntu desktop with a 2.3 GHz – Intel Xeon Gold 5118 processor. For GPU latency, we compile the models using NVIDIA TensorRT library (v8.0.1.6) and run on a single RTX-2080Ti GPU with batch size set to 1. We report the median latency value out of 100 runs.

### 4. Experiments

Image Classification on ImageNet-1K We evaluate MobileOne models on ImageNet [10] dataset, which consists of 1.28 million training images and a validation set with 50,000 images from 1,000 classes. All models are trained from scratch using PyTorch [46] library on a machine with 8 NVIDIA GPUs. All models are trained for 300 epochs with an effective batch size of 256 using SGD with momentum [51] optimizer. We use label smoothing regularization [52] with cross entropy loss with smoothing factor set to 0.1 for all models. The initial learning rate is 0.1 and annealed using a cosine schedule [42]. Initial weight decay coefficient is set to 10−4 and annealed to 10−5 using the same cosine schedule as described in [42]. We use AutoAugment [7] to train only the bigger variants of MobileOne, i.e. S2, S3, and S4. The strength of autoaugmentation and image resolution is progressively increased during training as introduced in [56]. We list the details in supplementary material. For smaller variants of MobileOne, i.e.

S0 and S1 we use standard augmentation – random resized cropping and horizontal flipping. We also use EMA (Exponential Moving Average) weight averaging with decay constant of 0.9995 for training all versions of MobileOne. At test time, all MobileOne models are evaluated on images of resolution 224 × 224. In Table 9, we compare against all recent efficient models that are evaluated on images of resolution 224×224 while having a parameter count <20 Million and trained without distillation as done in prior works like [5,45]. FLOP counts are reported using the fvcore [17] library.

We show that even the smallest variants of transformer architectures have a latency upwards of 4ms on mobile device. Current state-of-the-art MobileFormer [5] attains top-1 accuracy of 79.3% with a latency of 70.76ms, while MobileOne-S4 attains 79.4% with a latency of only 1.86ms which is ∼38× faster on mobile. MobileOne-S3 has 1% better top-1 accuracy than EfficientNet-B0 and is faster by 11% on mobile. Our models have a lower latency even on CPU and GPU compared to competing methods.

Knowledge distillation Efficient models are often distilled from a bigger teacher model to further boost the performance. We demonstrate the performance of MobileOne backbones using state-of-the-art distillation recipe suggested in [48]. From Table 10, our models outperform competing models of similar or higher parameter count. Train-time overparameterization enables our models to distill to better performance even though they have similar or smaller parameter count than competing models. In fact, MobileOne-S4 outperforms even ResNet-50 model which has 72.9% more parameters. MobileOne-S0 has 0.4M less parameters at inference than MobileNetV3-Small and obtains 2.8% better top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k dataset.

Object detection on MS-COCO To demonstrate the versatility of MobileOne, we use it as the backbone feature extractor for a single shot object detector SSD [38]. Following [47], we replace standard convolutions in SSD head with separable convolutions, resulting in a version of SSD called SSDLite. The model is trained using the mmdetection library [3] on the MS COCO dataset [37]. The input resolution is set to 320×320 and the model is trained for 200 epochs as described in [45]. For more detailed hyperparameters please refer to the supplementary material. We report mAP@IoU of 0.50:0.05:0.95 on the validation set of MS COCO in Table 11. Our best model outperforms MNASNet by 27.8% and best version of MobileViT [45] by 6.1%. We show qualitative results in the supplementary material.

Semantic Segmentation on Pascal VOC and ADE 20k We use MobileOne as the backbone for a Deeplab V3 segmentation network [4] using the cvnets library [45]. The VOC models were trained on the augmented Pascal VOC dataset [16] for 50 epochs following the training procedure of [45]. The ADE 20k [65] models were trained using the same hyperparameters and augmentations. For more detailed hyperparameters, please refer to the supplementary

Robustness to corruption We evaluate MobileOne and competing models on the following benchmarks, ImageNet-A [28], a dataset that contains naturally occuring examples that are misclassified by resnets. ImageNet-R [25], a dataset that contains natural renditions of ImageNet object classes with different textures and local image statistics. ImageNet-Sketch [59], a dataset that contains black and white sketches of all ImageNet classes, obtained using google image queries. ImageNet-C [26], a dataset that consists of algorithmically generated corruptions (blur, noise) applied to the ImageNet test-set. We follow the protocol set by [44] for all the evaluations. We use pretrained weights provided by Timm Library [60] for the evaluations. From Table 12, MobileOne outperforms other efficient architectures significantly on out-of-distribution benchmarks like ImageNet-R and ImageNet-Sketch. Our model is less robust to corruption when compared to MobileNetV3- L, but outperforms MobileNetV3-L on out-of-distribution benchmarks. Our model outperforms MobileNetV3-S, MobileNetV2 variants and EfficientNet-B0 on both corruption and out-of-distribution benchmarks as seen in Table 12.

Comparison with Micro Architectures Recently [22, 36] introduced architectures that were extremely efficient in terms of FLOPS and parameter count. But architectural choices introduced in these micro architectures like [36], do not always result in lower latency models. MicroNet uses dynamic activations which are extremely inefficient as

| Model | Latency(ms) | Clean | IN-C (↓) | IN-A | IN-R | IN-SK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MobileNetV3-S | 0.83 | 67.9 | 86.5 | 2.0 | 27.3 | 16.2 |
| MobileOne-S0 | 0.79 | 71.4 | 86.4 | 2.3 | 32.9 | 19.3 |

Table 12. Results on robustness benchmark datasets following protocol set by [44]. For ImageNet-C mean corruption error is reported (lower is better) and for other datasets Top-1 accuracy is reported (higher is better). Results are grouped following Table 9

Table 13. Performance of various micro-architecture models on ImageNet-1k validation set. Note, we replace swish activations with ReLU in TinyNets for a fair comparison.

demonstrated in Table 2. In fact, smaller variants of MobileOne can easily outperform previous state-of-the-art micro architectures. Please see supplementary materials for more details on MobileOne micro architectures. In Table 13, our models have similar latency as TinyNets, but have significantly lower parameter count and better top-1 accuracy. MobileOne-µ1, is 2× smaller and has 6.3% better top-1 accuracy while having similar latency as TinyNet-E.

### 5. Discussion

We have proposed an efficient, general-purpose backbone for mobile devices. Our backbone is suitable for general tasks such as image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. We show that in the efficient regime, latency may not correlate well with other metrics like parameter count and FLOPs. Furthermore, we analyze the efficiency bottlenecks for various architectural components used in modern efficient CNNs by measuring their latency directly on a mobile device. We empirically show the improvement in optimization bottlenecks with the use of reparameterizable structures. Our model scaling strategy with the use of re-parameterizable structures attains state-of-theart performance while being efficient both on a mobile device and a desktop CPU.

Limitations and Future Work Although, our models are state-of-the-art within the regime of efficient architectures, the accuracy lags large models [39, 40]. Future work will aim at improving the accuracy of these lightweight models. We will also explore the use of our backbone for faster inference on other computer vision applications not explored in this work such as optical flow, depth estimation, 3D reconstruction, etc.

### A. Figures

Figure 1 from the main paper has been enlarged in Figures 5, 6, 7.

### B. Benchmarking

We treat MobileNetV3 [30] in a special way since their H-swish operator is optimized for certain hardware platforms and not for others. Howard et al. [30] show that Hswish can obtain similar performance as ReLU when platform specific optimizations are applied. Therefore, while benchmarking for latency, we replace the H-swish layers with ReLU layers and then report the latency of MobileNetV3.

#### B.1. Additional Benchmarks

We have shown the efficiency of our model with comparisons on CPU, desktop GPU (RTX-2080Ti) and Mobile (iPhone 12). Additionally, in Table 14, we port existing architectures to Pixel-6 TPU and compare with our model. We observe that MobileOne achieves state-of-theart accuracy-latency trade-off on TPU as well.

### C. Image Classification

#### C.1. Training details

All models are trained from scratch using PyTorch [46] library on a machine with 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. All models are trained for 300 epochs with an effective batch size of 256 using SGD with momentum [51] optimizer. We follow progressive training curriculum [56] for faster training and better generalization. Throughout training the image resolution and the augmentation strength(α) is gradually increased, see Table 15. The magnitude for augmentations in AutoAugment [7] policy are between 0-9, we simply multiply α with this value to simulate variable strength of autoaugmentation. AutoAugment [7] is used to train only the bigger variants of MobileOne, i.e. S2, S3, and S4. For smaller variants of MobileOne, i.e. S0 and S1 we use standard augmentation – random resized cropping and horizontal flipping. We use label smoothing regularization [52] with cross entropy loss with smoothing factor set to 0.1 for all models. The initial learning rate is 0.1 and annealed using a cosine schedule [42]. Initial weight decay coefficient is set to 10−4 and annealed to 10−5 using the same cosine schedule. We also use EMA (Exponential Moving Average) weight averaging with decay constant of 0.9995 for training all versions of MobileOne.

#### C.2. Analysis of Training Recipes

Recent models introduce their own training recipe including regularization techniques to train them to competitive accuracies. We ablate over some of the commonly used recipes to train EfficientNet, MobileNetV3-L, MixNet-S, MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV1 in Table 16. Mainly, we report the following,

- Results from original training recipes of the respective models. (baselines)
- Results from training the models using recipe used to train MobileOne models.
- Results obtained by adding EMA, Progressive Learning (PL) and Annealing Weight decay (AWD) to the original recipe proposed by respective works.

All runs below have been reproduced using Timm library [60]. For a fair comparison all models are trained for 300 epochs. From Table 16, we observe that our models use less regularization techniques as opposed to competing models like EfficientNet, MobileNetV3-L and MixNet-S to reach competitive accuracies. When we apply our training recipe to the competing models, there is no improvement in models like EfficientNet, MobileNetV3-L and MixNet-S. There are slight improvements in MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV1. However, the accuracy at iso-latency gap between our models is still large. When progressive learning and annealing weight decay is used with baseline recipes, we obtain additional improvements, for example MobileNetV1, gets 1% improvement and MobileNetV2 ×1.4 gets 0.5% improvement.

#### C.3. Sensitivity to Random Seeds

Our model and training runs are stable and give similar performance with different random seeds, see Table 18.

### D. Micro Architectures

In Table 17, we provide specifications for micro variants of MobileOne introduced in Table 13 of main paper. Rather than optimizing for FLOPs, as done in [21, 36] we sample variants that are significantly smaller in parameter count and use trivial overparameterization to train these architectures to competitive accuracies.

#### D.1. Effectiveness of Overparameterization

We find that additional overparameterization branches benefits smaller variants more than it does for larger variants. In our experiments, we found that smaller variants improve consistently with additional overparameterization branches. Note, for all the experiments in Table 19, we use the same hyperparameters as described in Section 4 of main paper.

### E. Object Detection

#### E.1. Training details

SSDLite models were trained for 200 epochs using cosine learning rate schedule with warmup, following [45]. Linear warmup schedule with a warmup ratio of 0.001 for 4500 iterations was used. Image size of 320×320 was used for both training and evaluation, following [45]. We used SGD with momentum optimizer [51] with an initial learning rate of 0.05, momentum of 0.9 and weight decay of 0.0001 for all the models. We use an effective batchsize of 192, following [3]. The models were trained on a machine with 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

#### E.2. Qualitative Results

Visualizations in Figure 8 are generated using image demo.py [3] with default thresholds in MMDetection library [3]. We compare MobileNetV2-SSDLite

### F. Semantic Segmentation

#### F.1. Training details

We use the MobileViT repository [45] to train our semantic segmentation models and adopt their hyperparameter settings. Both VOC and ADE20k segmentation models were trained for 50 epochs using cosine learning rate with a maximum learning rate of 10−4 and minimum learning rate of 10−6 . We use 500 warmup iterations. The segmentation head has a learning rate multiplier of 10. EMA is used with a momentum of 5 × 10−4 . We use AdamW optimizer [41] with weight decay of 0.01. For VOC, the model is trained on both MS-COCO and VOC data simultaneously following Mehta et al [45]. For both VOC and ADE20k, the only augmentations used are random resize, random crop, and horizontal flipping.

#### F.2. Qualitative Results

We provide qualitative results for semantic segmentation in Figure 9. Our method performs better than MobileViT-S-DeepLabV3 as shown. In row 1, we show that MobileViT-S misclassifies background as airplane. In row 2 and row 6, our method is able to resolve fine details such as the leg of the horse and tiny birds. In row 3, MobileViT-S misclassfies the couch. In row 4, our method is able to segment large foreground object at a close-up view. In row 5, our method segments small objects such as the buses.

#### Abstract

We introduce a critical string theory in two dimensions and demonstrate that this theory, viewed as two-dimensional quantum gravity on the worldsheet, is equivalent to a double-scaled matrix integral. The worldsheet theory consists of Liouville CFT with central charge c ≥ 25 coupled to timelike Liouville CFT with central charge 26−c. The double-scaled matrix integral has as its leading density of states the universal Cardy density of primaries in a two-dimensional CFT, thus motivating the name Virasoro minimal string. The duality holds for any value of the continuous parameter c and reduces to the JT gravity/matrix integral duality in the large central charge limit. It thus provides a precise stringy realization of JT gravity. The main observables of the Virasoro minimal string are quantum analogues of the Weil-Petersson volumes, which are computed as absolutely convergent integrals of worldsheet CFT correlators over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces.

By exploiting a relation of the Virasoro minimal string to three-dimensional gravity and intersection theory on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, we are able to give a direct derivation of the duality. We provide many checks, such as explicit numerical — and in special cases, analytic — integration of string diagrams, the identification of the CFT boundary conditions with asymptotic boundaries of the two-dimensional spacetime, and the matching between the leading non-perturbative corrections of the worldsheet theory and the matrix integral. As a byproduct, we discover natural conformal boundary conditions for timelike Liouville CFT.

# Part I Introduction and summary

## 1 Introduction

String theories with a low number of target spacetime dimensions have proven to be valuable laboratories for understanding fundamental aspects of string theory. Rich phenomena such as holographic duality (for reviews, see [1–7]), non-perturbative effects mediated by D-instantons [8–20], and time-dependent stringy dynamics such as rolling tachyons [21–24], persist in low-dimensional string theories yet remain more computationally tractable than in their higher-dimensional counterparts.

At the same time, the direct approach of worldsheet string perturbation theory in the Polyakov formalism of integrating conformal field theory (CFT) correlators over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, while being explicit and familiar, often obscures the underlying simplicity of the physics of the model. For instance, the two-dimensional c = 1 or type 0A/0B string theories admit a simpler description of the spacetime strings in terms of a doublescaled matrix quantum mechanics. Similarly, worldsheet theories of strings propagating in certain AdS3 backgrounds are more simply described in terms of their spacetime boundary CFT2 dual [25–29]. In these examples, the simpler and more illuminating description is the (spacetime) holographic dual.

Another important low-dimensional string theory model is the minimal string [30, 31], whose worldsheet theory is composed of a Virasoro minimal model CFT with central charge c <ˆ 1 and Liouville CFT with c > 25 that together with the bc-ghost system form a critical worldsheet theory. This string model has been a fruitful arena for investigating aspects of two-dimensional quantum gravity and their relation to double-scaled matrix integrals [32–34] (for reviews, see [2, 35]). As a recent example, several works [36–39] have highlighted the (2, p) minimal string as a candidate string-theoretic description of Jackiw–Teitelboim (or linear) dilaton quantum gravity in the p → ∞ limit.

The main purpose of this paper is to investigate a new critical string theory that we will refer to as Virasoro minimal string theory, for reasons to be described below. When viewed as a model of two-dimensional quantum gravity on the worldsheet itself,1 this theory admits several distinct presentations that make its solvability more manifest. The Virasoro minimal

<sup>1</sup>See [40, 41] however, for a target spacetime interpretation of the worldsheet theory (1.1) for the particular case of ˆc = 1 and c = 25 Liouville CFTs, as strings propagating in a two-dimensional cosmological background.

string is defined by the following worldsheet conformal field theory,2

$c\geq25$$\oplus$$\hat{c}\leq1$$\oplus$$\mathfrak{bc}$-ghosts, (1.1) Liouville CFT$\oplus$$\mathfrak{bc}$-ghosts, (1.1)

where ˆc = 26 − c. Importantly, as described in more detail in section 3, the ˆc ≤ 1 Liouville CFT sector of (1.1) is not simply the analytic continuation of the c ≥ 25 Liouville CFT; rather, it is a distinct (non-unitary) solution to the CFT crossing equations for central charge in the range ˆc ≤ 1 that has been independently bootstrapped [42–44]. It has sometimes been referred to as "timelike Liouville CFT" in the literature, and we will adopt that name here.

In contrast to minimal string theory, the Virasoro minimal string (1.1) is a continuous family of critical worldsheet theories labeled by a single parameter c = 1+6(b+b −1 ) 2 ∈ R≥25. Furthermore, the main observables of the theory, worldsheet CFT correlators integrated over moduli space of Riemann surfaces — or quantum volumes of the string worldsheet — have analytic dependence on both the parameter c as well as the "external momenta" Pi labeling the on-shell vertex operator insertions on the worldsheet. For example, we find for the four punctured sphere and the once punctured torus

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{0,4}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4})=\frac{c-13}{24}+P_{1}^{2}+P_{2}^{2}+P_{3}^{2}+P_{4}^{2}\,\quad{\sf V}^{(b)}_{1,1}(P_{1})=\frac{c-13}{576}+\frac{1}{24}P_{1}^{2}.\tag{1.2}$$

Despite their origin as complicated integrals of CFT correlators over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, the resulting quantum volumes are extraordinarily simple functions of the central charge and external momenta. This suggests that the theory admits a much simpler representation. Indeed, in the main part of this paper we will leverage such alternative descriptions to derive relations that make V (b) g,n accessible for arbitrary g and n.

In this paper, we will show that in addition to the worldsheet CFT description (1.1), the Virasoro minimal string admits the following presentations: as a model of dilaton quantum gravity on the two-dimensional worldsheet subject to a sinh-dilaton potential; as a dimensional reduction of a certain sector of three-dimensional gravity; in terms of intersection theory on moduli space of Riemann surfaces; and in terms of a double-scaled matrix integral. These different presentations are summarized in figure 1.

The double-scaled matrix integral is perturbatively fully determined by its leading density of eigenvalues, which is given by

$$\varrho_{0}^{(b)}(E){\rm d}E=2\sqrt{2}\,\frac{\sinh(2\pi b\sqrt{E})\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}\sqrt{E})}{\sqrt{E}}\,{\rm d}E\,\tag{1.3}$$

<sup>2</sup>A brief aside on terminology: we refer to this as "Virasoro minimal string theory" because it is in a sense the minimal critical worldsheet theory involving only ingredients from Virasoro representation theory. Another point of view is that any bosonic string theory without a tachyon defines a minimal string theory. In contrast to the ordinary minimal string, the word "minimal" should not be read as having anything to do with Virasoro minimal model CFTs.

where E is the energy in the double-scaled matrix integral. Since (1.3) is the Cardy formula that universally governs the asymptotic density of states in any unitary compact CFT2, we call (1.1) the Virasoro minimal string. In the limit b → 0 (equivalently c → ∞) and upon rescaling the energy E the eigenvalue density of the Virasoro minimal string reduces to the sinh(√ E) dE density of JT gravity. At finite values of c the Virasoro minimal string (1.1) corresponds to a deformation of JT gravity, which is however completely distinct from the (2, p) minimal string.

Outline of this paper. The rest of the paper is organized in four parts. In the first part we summarize the different presentations of (1.1) and highlight our main results following the structure outlined in figure 1. Part II is split into three sections: In section 3 we define the worldsheet theory (1.1). We describe the spacelike and timelike Liouville conformal field theories corresponding to the theories with central charge c ≥ 25 and ˆc ≤ 1 in the Virasoro minimal string (1.1). We introduce suitable boundary conditions which will allow us to study also configurations with asymptotic boundaries. In section 4 we provide a three-dimensional perspective of the Virasoro minimal string and derive a cohomological interpretation for the quantum volumes V (b) g,n using intersection theory technology on the compactified moduli space of Riemann surfaces, Mg,n. We introduce and discuss the dual matrix model in section 5. Topological recursion demonstrates the equivalence between the matrix model and the intersection theory expressions for V (b) g,n. Part III contains further applications and direct checks of the Virasoro minimal string, such as a discussion of non-perturbative effects in section 6, the direct evaluation of string diagrams in section 7 and string diagrams in the presence of boundaries in section 8. We conclude in part IV with a discussion and a summary of open problems. Details of various calculations and conventions are summarized in appendices A, B, C and D.

## 2 Summary of results

### 2.1 Sinh-dilaton gravity

We begin by considering a two-dimensional theory of dilaton gravity. Its classical Euclidean action on a surface Σ takes the form

$$S_{\Sigma}[g,\Phi]=-\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Sigma}\mathrm{d}^{2}x\,\sqrt{g}\left(\Phi\mathcal{R}+W(\Phi)\right)-\int_{\partial\Sigma}\mathrm{d}x\,\sqrt{h}\,\Phi(K-1)\tag{2.1}$$ $$-\frac{S_{0}}{2\pi}\left(\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Sigma}\mathrm{d}^{2}x\sqrt{g}\,\mathcal{R}+\int_{\partial\Sigma}\mathrm{d}x\,\sqrt{h}K\right)\,\ \ W(\Phi)=\frac{\sinh(2\pi b^{2}\Phi)}{\sin(\pi b^{2})}\.$$

Here S −1 0 plays the role of a gravitational coupling. The model reduces to JT gravity in the limit b → 0, where the dilaton potential becomes linear [45, 46]. The second line in (2.1) is the Euler term which weighs different topologies according to their genus, see e.g. [36]. This theory has been considered before, see e.g. [37, 38, 47–49], but is not yet solvable by standard techniques, since it in particular falls outside the class of dilaton gravities considered in [39,50–52]. We will not discuss the theory directly in the metric formulation. Instead, we will make use of the following field redefinition

$$\phi=b^{-1}\rho-\pi b\Phi\ ,\qquad\chi=b^{-1}\rho+\pi b\Phi\ ,\tag{2.2}$$

where ρ is the Weyl factor of the worldsheet metric g = e2ρ g˜. At the level of the classical actions, this maps the theory to the direct sum of a spacelike Liouville theory of central charge c = 1 + 6(b + b −1 ) 2 and a timelike Liouville theory of central charge ˆc = 26 − c. See [38, 47] for more details. We can thus describe the theory as a two-dimensional string theory with a spacelike Liouville theory coupled to a timelike Liouville theory. The classical actions of spacelike and timelike Liouville theory are respectively given by

$$S_{\rm L}[\phi]=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\Sigma}{\rm d}^{2}x\sqrt{\tilde{g}}\left(\tilde{g}^{ij}\partial_{i}\phi\partial_{j}\phi+Q\widetilde{\cal R}\phi+4\pi\mu_{\rm st}{\rm e}^{2b\phi}\right)\,$$ (2.3a) \[\left.\begin{array}{c}\mbox{\rm\small$\frac{1}{4\pi}$}\int_{\Sigma}{\rm d}^{2}x\sqrt{\tilde{g}}\left(\tilde{g}^{ij}\partial_{i}\phi\partial_{j}\phi+Q\widetilde{\cal R}\phi+4\pi\mu_{\rm st}{\rm e}^{2b\phi}\right)\,\end{array}\right.

$$S_{\rm tL}[\chi]=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\Sigma}{\rm d}^{2}x\sqrt{\tilde{g}}\left(-\tilde{g}^{ij}\partial_{i}\chi\partial_{j}\chi-\widehat{Q}\widehat{\cal R}\chi+4\pi\mu_{\rm tL}{\rm e}^{2b\chi}\right).\tag{2.3b}$$

The dimensionless parameters Q, b and Q, b ˆb and their relation with each other is explained in the next section; µsL and µtL are dimensionful parameters of the theory that satisfy µsL = −µtL. 3 We emphasize that although we have introduced these theories at the level of their worldsheet Lagrangians, in what follows we will treat them as non-perturbatively well-defined conformal field theories that together define the worldsheet CFT.

### 2.2 Worldsheet definition

The most direct description of the Virasoro minimal string is that of a critical bosonic worldsheet theory consisting of spacelike and timelike Liouville conformal field theories with paired central charges c ≥ 25 and ˆc ≤ 1 respectively, together with the usual bc-ghost system with central charge cgh = −26. We emphasize that we view this string theory as a 2d theory of quantum gravity on the worldsheet (as opposed to a theory in target space), as depicted in figure 2.

We refer to Liouville theory with c ≥ 25 as spacelike Liouville theory whereas we refer to Liouville theory with ˆc ≤ 1 as timelike Liouville theory [55–58]. This distinction is important as the CFT data of timelike Liouville theory is not simply the analytic continuation of that of spacelike Liouville theory. In this paper, we will place a typographical hat on quantities that refer to the timelike Liouville sector of the worldsheet theory (1.1) in order to distinguish them from those in the spacelike Liouville sector. We parametrize the central charges and the Virasoro conformal weights of their operator spectra by

spacelike Liouville CFT: $c=1+6Q^{2}\;,\quad Q=b+b^{-1}\;,\quad h_{P}=\dfrac{Q^{2}}{4}+P^{2}\;,$ (2.4a), $$\widehat{\rho_{2}}$$. 

timelike Liouville CFT: $\hat{c}=1-6\widehat{Q}^{2}\;,\quad\widehat{Q}=\hat{b}^{-1}-\hat{b}\;,\quad\hat{h}_{\widehat{P}}=-\frac{\widehat{Q}^{2}}{4}+\widehat{P}^{2}\;.$ (2.4b)

<sup>3</sup> In the references [38, 39, 49, 53, 54], the timelike Liouville factor is replaced by a minimal model at the quantum level which then leads to the usual minimal string. In this paper, we will take the timelike Liouville factor seriously which leads to a completely different theory at the quantum level.

![](_page_9_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 2: A critical string background can be viewed as a model of quantum gravity on the two-dimensional worldsheet of the string, or as a model of strings propagating in target spacetime.

The parameters P and Pb are often referred to as the "Liouville momenta." With this parametrization b and ˆb are real valued and we can choose b, ˆb ∈ (0, 1]. Both spacelike and timelike Liouville CFT are noncompact solutions to the crossing equations with a continuous spectrum of (delta-function normalizable) scalar primary operators with conformal weights bounded from below by c−1 24 and cˆ−1 24 respectively. This corresponds to real values of the Liouville momenta P, Pb. We defer a more comprehensive discussion of these worldsheet CFTs to section 3.1.

The Virasoro minimal string is described on the worldsheet by coupling a spacelike Liouville theory to a timelike Liouville theory, as described classically in (2.2). Vanishing of the conformal anomaly of the combined theory imposes the condition ˆc = 26 − c and thus ˆb = b. The mass shell condition for physical states hP + hˆ Pb = 1 further implies Pb = ±iP. In summary we have

$\hat{b}=b\;,\quad\hat{P}=iP\;,$

where we chose one convention for the sign for concreteness. Hence, on-shell vertex operators in Virasoro minimal string theory involve external primary operators in timelike Liouville CFT with imaginary values of the Liouville momenta. Notably, imaginary values of Pb correspond to hˆ ≤ cˆ−1 24 and are thus not in the spectrum of timelike Liouville theory. Thus we will need to analytically continue the correlation functions of timelike Liouville theory away from real Liouville momenta. In fact this is a harmless operation and, contrary to spacelike Liouville theory, does not require contour deformations in the conformal block decomposition of worldsheet correlators. In [57], such an analytic continuation leads to the distinction of the internal and external spectrum. A similar analytic continuation is also necessary for the usual minimal string — there, primaries of the Virasoro minimal model are combined with vertex operators in Liouville theory that are not in the spectrum and so their correlation functions are necessarily defined by analytic continuation.

We will denote the primary operators in the spacelike/timelike Liouville CFTs of conformal weights hP and hˆ Pb by VP (z) and Vb Pb(z) respectively. Physical operators of the full worldsheet theory are hence represented by the following vertex operators built out of paired primaries of the spacelike and timelike Liouville CFTs, together with bc-ghosts,

$${\cal V}_{P}={\rm N}(P)\,\epsilon\,{\rm c}\,{\rm V}_{P}\,\hat{V}_{\hat{P}=iP}\,\,\,,\tag{2.6}$$

where N(P) is a normalization constant that will be fixed in section 7.

The observables in Virasoro minimal string theory are computed by worldsheet diagrams as usual in string theory. For a worldsheet with genus g and n external punctures we define

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\equiv\int_{{\cal M}_{g,n}}Z_{\rm gh}\langle V_{P_{1}}\ldots V_{P_{n}}\rangle_{g}\langle\widehat{V}_{iP_{1}}\ldots\widehat{V}_{iP_{n}}\rangle_{g}.\tag{2.7}$$

Here ⟨VP1 . . . VPn ⟩g is the correlation function of n primary operators on a genus-g Riemann surface in spacelike Liouville CFT, ⟨VbiP1 . . . VbiPn ⟩g is the corresponding correlator in timelike Liouville CFT, Zgh is the correlator of the bc-ghost system and the worldsheet CFT correlators are integrated over Mg,n, the moduli space of genus-g Riemann surfaces with n punctures. We will typically consider the worldsheet diagrams for real values of the external momenta Pj , but we will see that the analytic continuation to complex momenta is often straightforward. A special feature of the Virasoro minimal string is that at least for real values of the external momenta, these diagrams are absolutely convergent integrals over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. The Liouville momenta Pj play a role analogous to that of the geodesic lengths in JT gravity, with V (b) g,n playing the role of the Weil-Petersson volumes. We shall discuss the precise reduction of V (b) g,n to the Weil-Petersson volumes in section 2.7. For this reason we will refer to V (b) g,n as "quantum volumes." In the full theory of quantum gravity, it is necessary to sum over all topologies which are weighted according to the Euler characteristic. We have

$${\sf V}_{n}^{(b)}(S_{0};P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\equiv\sum_{g=0}^{\infty}{\rm e}^{(2-2g-n)S_{0}}\,{\sf V}_{g,n}^{(b)}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\,\tag{2.8}$$

This sum is asymptotic, but can be made sense of via resurgence.

Given the relationship between the Virasoro minimal string and two-dimensional dilaton gravity, it is natural to anticipate that it can compute observables with asymptotic boundaries in addition to the string diagrams with finite boundaries corresponding to external vertex operator insertions.4 This is achieved on the worldsheet by equipping the worldsheet CFT with particular boundary conditions. We summarize the mechanism by which we incorporate asymptotic boundaries in section 2.5 and the precise worldsheet boundary conformal field theory in section 3.2. We in particular introduce a new family of conformal boundary conditions for timelike Liouville theory — which we dub "half-ZZ" boundary conditions — that will play an important role in the incorporation of asymptotic boundaries and in mediating non-perturbative effects in Virasoro minimal string theory.

### 2.3 Dual matrix integral

The central claim of this paper is that the Virasoro minimal string is dual to a double-scaled Hermitian matrix integral. We will provide evidence that the leading density of states for this double-scaled matrix integral is given by

$$\varrho_{0}^{(b)}(E){\rm d}E=2\sqrt{2}\,\frac{\sinh(2\pi b\sqrt{E})\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}\sqrt{E})}{\sqrt{E}}\,{\rm d}E\ ,\tag{2.9}$$

where E = P 2 = hP − c−1 24 is the energy in the matrix integral. For b → 0, one of the sinh's linearizes and we recover the famous sinh(√ E) dE density of states of JT gravity [36].

(2.9) is the universal normalized Cardy density of states in any unitary CFT2, which is what motivated us to call the bulk theory the Virasoro minimal string. It is the modular S-matrix for the vacuum Virasoro character that controls the high energy growth of states in a CFT2,

$$\chi^{(b)}_{\rm vac}\left(-\frac{1}{\tau}\right)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!1P\,\rho^{(b)}_{0}(P)\,\chi^{(b)}_{P}(\tau)\,\ \ {\rm with}\ \ \rho^{(b)}_{0}(P)\equiv4\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi bP)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}P)\,\tag{2.10}$$

where χ (b) P (τ ) = q P 2 η(τ ) −1 are the non-degenerate Virasoro characters with weight hP . Here τ is the torus modulus, with q = e 2πiτ and η(τ ) the Dedekind eta function. The density of states is directly related to the spectral curve [59] which is the basic data for the topological recursion/loop equations in a double-scaled matrix integral. Since in recent CFT literature and the random matrix theory literature it is common to denote the densities of states by the same Greek letter, we distinguish the two cases by using ρ (b) 0 in the CFT and ϱ (b) 0 (2.9) in the matrix integral context.

The matrix integral associated to (2.9) turns out to be non-perturbatively unstable, unless b = 1. This is diagnosed by computing the first non-perturbative correction to the density

<sup>4</sup> In the JT gravity limit, these finite boundaries become geodesic boundaries with lengths fixed in terms of the data of the vertex operator insertions as in (2.22). For this reason, in a slight abuse of notation, we will sometimes use the terms finite boundaries and geodesic boundaries interchangeably.

of states. Perturbatively, no eigenvalue can be smaller than zero, but non-perturbatively, eigenvalues can tunnel to this classically forbidden regime. The leading non-perturbative contribution to the density of states in the forbidden E < 0 region takes the form

$$\langle\varrho^{(b)}(E)\rangle=-\frac{1}{8\pi E}\exp\left(2\sqrt{2}\,e^{S_{0}}\Big{(}\frac{\sin(2\pi Q\sqrt{-E})}{Q}-\frac{\sin(2\pi\widehat{Q}\sqrt{-E}\,)}{\widehat{Q}}\Big{)}\right)\,,\tag{2.11}$$

where Q and Qb were defined in (2.4). Unless b = 1, this can become arbitrarily large for sufficiently negative E and thus renders the model unstable. One can define a non-perturbative completion of the matrix integral by modifying the integration contour over the eigenvalues of the matrices. Such a non-perturbative completion is ambiguous and any choice requires the inclusion of non-perturbative corrections to the gravity partition functions. These nonperturbative corrections correspond to ZZ-instanton corrections on the worldsheet and will be discussed in section 6.1. The worldsheet exhibits the same non-perturbative ambiguities, presumably related to the choice of integration contour in string field theory [60]. Via resurgence, the computation of non-perturbative effects allows us also to extract the large-genus asymptotics of the quantum volumes,

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,h}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\stackrel{{g>1}}{{\approx}}\frac{\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{\sqrt{2}\sin(2\pi b^{j})}{P_{j}}}{2^{\frac{1}{2}}\pi^{\frac{1}{2}}(1-b^{j})^{\frac{1}{2}}}\times\left(\frac{4\sqrt{2}b\sin(\pi b^{2})}{1-b^{4}}\right)^{2-2g-n}\times\Gamma\big{(}2g+n-\frac{5}{2}\big{)}.\tag{2.12}$$

### 2.4 Deformed Mirzakhani recursion relation

Our conjecture for the dual matrix integral leads to recursion relations for the quantum volumes V (b) g,n. In particular we have

P1V (b) g,n(P1, P) = Z ∞ 0 (2P dP) (2P ′ dP ′ ) H(P + P ′ , P1) V (b) g−1,n+1(P, P′ , P) + X g h=0 X I⊔J={2,...,n} V (b) h,|I|+1(P, PI )V (b) g−h,|J|+1(P ′ , PJ ) + Xn i=2 Z ∞ 0 (2P dP) H(P, P1 + Pi) + H(P, P1 − Pi) V (b) g,n−1 (P, P \ Pi) , (2.13)

where P = (P2, . . . , Pn). The different terms correspond to the three topologically different ways in which one can embed a three-punctured sphere with boundary P1 into Σg,n. They are displayed in figure 3. The function H(x, y) takes the following form

$$H(x,y)=\frac{y}{2}-\int_{0}^{\infty}{\rm d}t\,\frac{\sin(4\pi tx)\sin(4\pi ty)}{\sinh(2\pi bt)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}t)}.\tag{2.14}$$

![](_page_13_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 3: The three different ways of embedding a three-punctured sphere into a surface, corresponding to the three different contributions in eq. (2.13).

The integral over t is not elementary, except in special cases. For example, we have for b = 1

$$H(x,y)\big{|}_{b=1}=\frac{-y\cosh(2\pi y)+x\sinh(2\pi y)+y\,{\rm e}^{-2\pi x}}{4\sinh(\pi(x+y))\sinh(\pi(x-y))}.\tag{2.15}$$

This is a deformed version of Mirzakhani's celebrated recursion relation [61] to which it reduces in the limit b → 0. We wrote an efficient implementation of this recursion relation in Mathematica, which is appended as an ancillary file to the submission.

### 2.5 Asymptotic boundaries

So far, we have only explained how to efficiently compute gravity partition functions with finite boundaries. One can add asymptotic boundaries just like in JT gravity by computing the partition function of a disk and of a punctured disk (aka trumpet) and glue them to the bulk volumes.

The disk and trumpet partition function take the form

$${\cal Z}^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(\beta)={\rm e}^{\frac{\pi^{2}}{b\beta}}\prod_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{1}{1-{\rm e}^{-\frac{4\pi^{2}n}{\beta}}}=\frac{1}{\eta(\frac{\beta_{1}}{2\pi})}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\beta}}\left({\rm e}^{\frac{\pi^{2}\alpha^{2}}{\beta}}-{\rm e}^{\frac{\pi^{2}\beta^{2}}{\beta}}\right)\;,\tag{2.16a}$$

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm rrumpet}(\beta;P)={\rm e}^{-\frac{4\pi^{2}}{\beta}(P^{2}-\frac{1}{2^{4}})}\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{1-{\rm e}^{-\frac{4\pi^{2}n}{\beta}}}=\frac{1}{\eta(\frac{\beta n}{2^{n}})}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\beta}}\,{\rm e}^{-\frac{4\pi^{2}p^{2}}{\beta}}.\tag{2.16b}$$

From the first expression, one can recognize that these partition functions are simply the Virasoro vacuum character and non-vacuum character in the dual channel, respectively. In the second expression, we used the modular properties of the eta-function to rewrite it in terms of the β channel.

The reason why the Virasoro character appears is that these 2d gravity partition functions are actually equal to a partition function of a chiral half of three-dimensional gravity theory on Σg,n × S 1 . We will explain this in section 4, where we derive these formulas. In our convention of β, the size of the thermal circle is 4π 2 β . Thus, for the disk, we are actually computing the chiral 3d gravity partition function on a solid cylinder which gives the vacuum Virasoro character in the boundary. Similarly the trumpet partition function is equal to the 3d gravity partition function on a solid cylinder with a black hole inside, which gives a generic Virasoro character in the boundary.

The dual matrix integral explained in section 2.3 only captures the partition function of primaries. This should be intuitively clear since Virasoro descendants are dictated by symmetry and thus cannot be statistically independent from the primaries. We account for this by stripping off the factor η( βi 2π ) and denote the primary partition functions by Z (b) . Thus we have

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(\beta)=\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\beta}}\left({\rm e}^{\frac{\pi^{2}Q^{2}}{\beta}}-{\rm e}^{\frac{\pi^{2}\tilde{Q}^{2}}{\beta}}\right)\tag{2.17a}$$ $$\left(\beta,P\right)=\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\beta}}\ \ -\frac{4\pi^{2}P^{2}}{\beta}\tag{2.17b}$$

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm trumpet}(\beta;P)=\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\beta}}\;{\rm e}^{-\frac{4\pi^{2}P^{2}}{\beta}}\;.\tag{2.17b}$$

The trumpet partition function has the same form as in JT gravity [36]. Taking the inverse Laplace transform of the disk partition function of the primaries Z (b) disk leads to the eigenvalue distribution ϱ (b) 0 given in equation (2.9), see subsection 5.2 for more details.

We can then compute the partition function with any number of asymptotic boundaries as follows

$$Z^{(b)}_{g,n}(\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{n})=\int_{0}^{\infty}\prod_{j=1}^{n}\left(2P_{j}\,{\rm d}P_{j}\,Z^{(b)}_{\rm trumpet}(\beta_{j},P_{j})\right){\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n}).\tag{2.18}$$

Notice that the same measure 2P dP appears as in the deformed Mirzakhani's recursion relation (2.13). We derive this gluing measure from 3d gravity in section 4.1. Up to normalization, this is the same measure as in JT gravity. The gluing procedure is sketched in figure 4.

### 2.6 Intersection theory on moduli space

There is a last way to describe the theory – in terms of intersection theory on the compactified moduli space of Riemann surfaces Mg,n. This forms the conceptual bridge between the worldsheet description of section 2.2 and the description in terms of a random matrix integral in section 2.3 and allows us to essentially derive the duality.

From a bulk perspective, this also gives a far more efficient way to compute the integrals over Mg,n defined in (2.7), thanks to efficient algorithms to compute intersection numbers on

![](_page_15_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 4: Gluing trumpets to the bulk gives the partition function of the Virasoro minimal string on arbitrary topologies with asymptotic boundaries.

moduli space. We used admcycles [62] in practice. We obtain with the intersection theory approach for example

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{0,4}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{4})=\frac{c-13}{24}+\sum_{j=1}^{4}P_{j}^{2}\,\tag{2.19a}$$

$${\sf V}_{1,1}^{(0)}(P_{1})=\frac{1}{24}\left(\frac{c-13}{24}+P_{1}^{2}\right)\,\tag{2.19b}$$

$$\mathsf{V}_{0,5}^{(0)}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{5})=\frac{5c^{2}-130c+797}{1152}+\frac{c-13}{8}\sum_{j=1}^{5}P_{j}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^{5}P_{j}^{4}+2\sum_{j<k}P_{j}^{2}P_{k}^{2}\,\tag{2.19c}$$

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{1,2}(P_{1},P_{2})=\frac{c^{2}-26c+153}{9216}+\frac{c-13}{288}(P_{1}^{2}+P_{2}^{2})+\frac{1}{48}(P_{1}^{2}+P_{2}^{2})^{2}.\tag{2.19d}$$

These can of course also be obtained from the recursion (2.13). We have compiled a much larger list of quantum volumes in appendix B.

Our main claim, which connects the worldsheet and matrix integral descriptions of the Virasoro minimal string, is that V (b) g,n(P1, . . . , Pn) defined in eq. (2.7) is given by the following intersection number of Mg,n:

$$\mathsf{V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})=\int_{\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}}\mathrm{td}(\mathcal{M}_{g,n})\,\exp\left(\frac{c}{24}\,\kappa_{1}+\sum_{j=1}^{n}\left(P_{j}^{2}-\frac{1}{24}\right)\psi_{j}\right)\tag{2.20}$$ $$=\int_{\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}}\exp\left(\frac{c-13}{24}\,\kappa_{1}+\sum_{j=1}^{n}P_{j}^{2}\psi_{j}-\sum_{m\geq1}\frac{B_{2m}}{(2m)(2m)!}\,\kappa_{2m}\right)\,.$$

Here, ψj and κn are standard cohomology classes on Mg,n whose definition we briefly recall in appendix A. B2m are the Bernoulli numbers. The Todd class of the tangent bundle of moduli space that appears in the first line, can be rewritten in terms of the ψ- and κ-classes via the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem, which leads to the expression in the second line.5 Note that the integrand should be viewed as a formal power series. We expand the exponential and pick out the terms of the top degree 3g − 3 + n and integrate them over moduli space.

It is straightforward to derive two identities from (2.20) which are the analogue of the dilaton and string (or puncture) equations of topological gravity [63–65]. This requires some algebraic geometry and the proof can be found in appendix D. They take the form

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n+1}(P=\frac{iQ}{2},{\sf P})-{\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n+1}(P=\frac{iQ}{2},{\sf P})=(2g-2+n){\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}({\sf P})\,\tag{2.21a}$$ $$\int_{\frac{iQ}{2}}^{\frac{iQ}{2}}2P\,{\rm d}P\ {\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n+1}(P,{\sf P})=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\int_{0}^{P_{j}}2P_{j}\,{\rm d}P_{j}\ {\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}({\sf P}).\tag{2.21b}$$

j=1

To state these formulas, one has to analytically continue the quantum volumes to complex values of Pi . We used the parametrization (2.4). These two equations together with polynomiality of the quantum volumes that follows from the intersection expression (2.20) determine them completely at genus 0 and 1 [63].

### 2.7 Relation to JT gravity and the minimal string

2

As already noticed at the level of the action (2.1) or the density of states for the dual matrix integral (2.9), the Virasoro minimal string reduces to JT gravity in the limit b → 0. JT gravity has been studied extensively in the literature, see [36] and many subsequent works. This reduction precisely realizes an idea of Seiberg and Stanford about the relation between the minimal string and JT gravity [37].

Let us make this precise at the level of the quantum volumes V (b) g,n and the partition functions Z (b) g,n. In the limit b → 0, one has to scale the Liouville momenta like

$P=\frac{\ell}{4\pi b}$,

where ℓ are the geodesic lengths on hyperbolic surfaces. This relation is further explained in section 4.2. We also scale the boundary temperatures as follows,

$$\beta=\frac{1}{b^{2}}\,\beta^{\rm JT}\tag{2.23}$$

<sup>5</sup>Here it is important whether we talk about the Todd class of the tangent bundle of Mg,n or Mg,n, since they differ in their behaviour near the boundary of moduli space. We will mention further details about this subtlety in section 4.2.

and hold β JT fixed in the limit b → 0. From the intersection point of view (2.20), it is obvious that the quantum volumes reduce to the ordinary Weil-Petersson volumes by using eq. (A.6) and the fact that the Todd class becomes subleading in this limit. We have

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\stackrel{{b\to0}}{{\longrightarrow}}(8\pi^{2}b^{2})^{-3g+3-n}V_{g,n}(\ell_{1},\ldots,\ell_{n})\big{(}1+{\cal O}(b^{2})\big{)}\,\tag{2.24}$$

where Vg,n denote the Weil-Petersson volumes. In the presence of asymptotic boundaries, we have6

$$Z^{(b)}_{g,n}(\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{n})\stackrel{{b\to0}}{{\longrightarrow}}\big{(}8\pi^{2}b^{2}\big{)}^{\frac{3}{2}(2-2g-n)}Z^{\rm JT}_{g,n}(\beta_{1}^{\rm JT},\ldots,\beta_{n}^{\rm JT}).\tag{2.25}$$

The prefactor is raised to the Euler characteristic and hence can be absorbed into the definition of S0 in (2.1).

One might also wonder whether the Virasoro minimal string is related to the (2, p) minimal string which also admits a double-scaled dual matrix integral description [66–68]. Moreover, there are hints that the (2, p) minimal model could be obtained from timelike Liouville theory on the worldsheet by a certain gauging [69,70]. It has also been argued that the large p limit of the minimal string reduces to the JT gravity, albeit in the regime where vertex operators correspond to conical defect insertions instead of geodesic boundaries [37–39,52,54]. However, let us emphasize that the (2, p) minimal string and the Virasoro minimal string correspond to two completely different deformations of JT gravity and do not seem to have a direct relation. In particular the density of states of the dual matrix integrals are genuinely different.

<sup>6</sup>Here we are using standard conventions in JT gravity. In the language of [36], we set α = 1 and γ = 1 2 .

# Part II Dual descriptions

## 3 A worldsheet perspective

In this section we elucidate in more detail the worldsheet description of the Virasoro minimal string. Throughout we emphasize the exact formulation of the worldsheet CFTs in terms of their operator spectrum and OPE data.

### 3.1 Description of the worldsheet CFT

Spacelike Liouville CFT. Spacelike Liouville CFT is a non-perturbative solution to the CFT crossing equations that exists for all complex values of the central charge c away from the half-line (−∞, 1]. It defines a unitary CFT only if the central charge is real and satisfies c > 1. Its spectrum consists of a continuum of scalar Virasoro primary operators VP with conformal weights lying above the threshold Q2 4 = c−1 24 as parameterized in (2.4). It is a non-compact solution to the bootstrap equations, meaning that the identity operator is not a normalizable operator in the spectrum of the theory.7 There is significant evidence that Liouville CFT is the unique unitary CFT with c > 1 whose spectrum consists of only scalar Virasoro primaries (and indeed with primaries of bounded spins) [71–73].

The structure constants of Liouville CFT were famously bootstrapped by [74–77], and are given by the well-known DOZZ formula. In this work we find it convenient to adopt operator normalization conventions such that the DOZZ formula is equivalent to the universal formula

<sup>7</sup>The "spectrum" of Liouville CFT is a somewhat ambiguous notion; although sub-threshold operators are not (delta-function) normalizable in Liouville theory, we will see that one can often analytically continue observables in the theory to arbitrary values of the external Liouville momenta, corresponding for example to sub-threshold values of the conformal weights. However the fact that sub-threshold operators are nonnormalizable means that they do not appear as internal states in the conformal block decomposition of generic observables, and for this reason we reserve the term "spectrum" for the normalizable, above-threshold operators.

Cb that governs the asymptotics of CFT structure constants [73], namely8

$$\langle V_{P_{1}}(0)V_{P_{2}}(1)V_{P_{3}}(\infty)\rangle=C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3})\equiv\frac{\Gamma_{b}(2Q)\Gamma_{b}(\frac{Q}{2}\pm iP_{1}\pm iP_{2}\pm iP_{3})}{\sqrt{2}\Gamma_{b}(Q)^{3}\prod_{k=1}^{3}\Gamma_{b}(Q\pm2iP_{k})}.\tag{3.1}$$

Here Γb denotes the meromorphic double gamma function (see appendix C for a compendium of properties and representations of Γb) and the ± notation indicates a product over all eight possible sign choices. As an example Γb( Q 2 ±iP1 ±iP2 ±iP3) is a product over eight different factors. This in particular has the feature that it is invariant under reflections Pj → −Pj of the Liouville momenta. Although it is not a normalizable operator in the spectrum of Liouville theory, the identity operator is obtained by analytic continuation P → iQ 2 ≡ 1. The two-point function inherited from (3.1) is then given by

$$\langle V_{P_{1}}(0)V_{P_{2}}(1)\rangle=C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},1)=\frac{1}{\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P_{1})}(\delta(P_{1}-P_{2})+\delta(P_{1}+P_{2})).\tag{3.2}$$

Here ρ (b) 0 is given by the universal formula

$$\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)=4\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi bP)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}P).\tag{3.3}$$

Both the two-point function and the three-point function of Liouville CFT are universal quantities in two-dimensional conformal field theory. The reason for this is that they are crossing kernels for conformal blocks involving the identity operator. We have already seen in section 2.3 that ρ (b) 0 is the modular crossing kernel for the torus vacuum character, which is asymptotic to Cardy's formula for the universal density of high-energy states in a unitary compact 2d CFT. Similarly, Cb — which describes the asymptotic structure constants of high-energy states in a unitary compact 2d CFT — is the crossing kernel for the sphere four-point conformal block describing the exchange of the identity Virasoro Verma module:

The diagrams on the left- and right-hand sides of the above equation are respectively meant to denote the t- and s-channel Virasoro conformal blocks for the sphere four-point function of pairwise identical operators with conformal weights hP1 and hP2 .

<sup>8</sup>This function has been referred to as C0 in the recent CFT literature. Here we find it convenient to make the dependence on the central charge explicit. Also we find it appropriate to reserve the 0 subscript for ρ (b) 0 , which plays the role of the leading density of eigenvalues in the matrix model, whereas in the present application Cb is an exact CFT three-point function.

Together, this data is sufficient to compute any correlation function of local operators on any closed Riemann surface. This is achieved by the conformal block decomposition as follows:

$$\langle V_{P_{1}}\cdots V_{P_{n}}\rangle_{g}=\int_{\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}}\left(\prod_{a}\mathrm{d}P_{a}\,\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P_{a})\right)\left(\prod_{(j,k,l)}C_{b}(P_{j},P_{k},P_{l})\right)|\mathcal{F}_{g,n}^{(b)}(\mathbf{P}^{\mathrm{ext}};\mathbf{P}|\mathbf{m})|^{2}\;.\tag{3.5}$$

Here F (b) g,n are the genus-g n-point Virasoro conformal blocks with central charge c = 1+6Q2 , Q = b + b −1 ; Pext = (P1, . . . , Pn) denote the external Liouville momenta, and P and m collectively denote the 3g − 3 + n internal Liouville momenta Pa and the worldsheet moduli respectively. Left implicit in the definition of the conformal block is the choice of a channel C of the conformal block decomposition, which is specified by a decomposition of the worldsheet Riemann surface into 2g − 2 + n pairs of pants sewn along 3g − 3 + n cuffs, together with a choice of dual graph. The conformal block decomposition of the resulting correlator includes a factor of ρ (b) 0 for each internal weight corresponding to the complete set of states inserted at each cuff, and a factor of Cb for each pair of pants corresponding to the CFT structure constants. The resulting correlator is independent of the choice of channel in the conformal block decomposition because Liouville CFT solves the crossing equations.

A priori, for fixed worldsheet moduli, the correlation function (3.5) is a function defined for real external Liouville momenta Pext in the spectrum of the theory. However, the structure constants Cb are meromorphic functions of the Liouville momenta and we can readily consider the analytic continuation of (3.5) to complex Pext. But there may be subtleties in this analytic continuation. Even restricting to real values of the conformal weights, if the external operators have weights sufficiently below the threshold c−1 24 , then poles of the structure constants cross the contour of integration and the contour must be deformed such that the conformal block decomposition picks up additional discrete contributions associated with the residues of these poles. This can happen for example whenever there is a pair of external momenta Pj , Pk such that |Im(Pj ± Pk)| > Q 2 .

Timelike Liouville CFT. Timelike Liouville CFT is a solution to the CFT crossing equations for all values of the central charge on the half-line ˆc ≤ 1. Although less well-known than (and with some peculiar features compared to) spacelike Liouville theory, it furnishes an equally good solution to the CFT bootstrap that has been developed from various points of view over the years [43, 44, 56, 57, 78]. It is essential that timelike Liouville CFT is not given by the analytic continuation of spacelike Liouville theory to c ≤ 1, although as we will see the CFT data of the two theories are related.

Similarly to spacelike Liouville theory, the spectrum of timelike Liouville theory consists of a continuum of scalar Virasoro primaries Vb Pb with conformal weights hˆ Pb ≥ cˆ−1 24 = − Qb2 4

parameterized as in (2.4).9 Unlike spacelike Liouville theory, timelike Liouville theory with c <ˆ 1 never defines a unitary CFT in the sense that the spectrum contains primaries with negative conformal weights that violate the unitarity bound. Nevertheless, we will see that the structure constants of the theory are real in the cases of interest.

We adopt conventions such that the structure constants in timelike Liouville CFT are given by the inverse of an analytic continuation of the spacelike structure constants (3.1), in particular [43, 44, 56, 78, 79] .

$$\langle\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{1}}(0)\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{2}}(1)\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{3}}(\infty)\rangle=\widehat{C}_{\hat{b}}(\widehat{P}_{1},\widehat{P}_{2},\widehat{P}_{3})$$ $$\equiv\frac{1}{C_{\hat{b}}(i\widehat{P}_{1},i\widehat{P}_{2},i\widehat{P}_{3})}$$ $$=\frac{\sqrt{2}\Gamma_{b}(\hat{b}+\hat{b}^{-1})^{3}}{\Gamma_{b}(2\hat{b}+2\hat{b}^{-1})}\,\frac{\prod_{k=1}^{3}\Gamma_{b}(\hat{b}+\hat{b}^{-1}\pm2\widehat{P}_{k})}{\Gamma_{b}(\frac{\hat{b}\pm\hat{b}^{-1}}{2}\pm\widehat{P}_{1}\pm\widehat{P}_{2}\pm\widehat{P}_{3})}.\tag{3.6}$$

With a suitable contour of integration of the internal Liouville momenta in the conformal block decomposition that we will discuss shortly, correlation functions in timelike Liouville CFT with these structure constants have been shown to solve the CFT crossing equations numerically [78,80], see also [40]. We note in passing that although the spectrum of timelike Liouville contains a weight zero operator (with Pb = Qb 2 ), it is not the degenerate representation corresponding to the identity operator; indeed the two-point function is not obtained by analytic continuation of (3.6) to Pb3 = Qb 2 . The latter is instead given by

$$\langle\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{1}}(0)\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{2}}(1)\rangle=\frac{2\rho_{0}^{(\hat{b})}(i\widehat{P})}{(i\widehat{P})^{2}}(\delta(\widehat{P}_{1}-\widehat{P}_{2})+\delta(\widehat{P}_{1}+\widehat{P}_{2})).\tag{3.7}$$

Correlation functions in timelike Liouville CFT are then computed by the following conformal block decomposition

$$\langle\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{1}}\cdots\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{n}}\rangle_{\theta}=\int_{\cal C}\prod_{a}\frac{{\rm d}\widehat{P}_{a}\left(i\widehat{P}_{a}\right)^{2}}{2\rho_{0}^{(b)}(i\widehat{P}_{a})}\Bigg{(}\prod_{(j,k,l)}\frac{1}{C_{b}(i\widehat{P}_{j},i\widehat{P}_{k},i\widehat{P}_{l})}\Bigg{)}|{\cal F}_{\theta,n}^{(b)}(\widehat{\bf P}^{\rm ext};\widehat{\bf P}|{\bf m})|^{2}\,\tag{3.8}$$

where C denotes the contour R + iε, ε > 0 (see figure 5). It warrants further emphasis that the contour of integration over the internal Liouville momenta Pb in the conformal block decomposition of the timelike Liouville correlation function is shifted by an amount ε above

<sup>9</sup>Sometimes states with purely imaginary Pb are described as the spectrum of timelike Liouville theory, since they turn out to be natural from the point of view of the Lagrangian formulation of the theory. Here we will reserve that terminology for operators that appear in the conformal block decomposition of correlation functions.

the real axis. Such a shift is required to avoid the infinitely many poles of the timelike Liouville structure constants on the real Pb axis at

poles of $\widehat{C}_{\hat{b}}$: $$\widehat{P}_{j}=\pm\frac{1}{2}\left((m+1)\hat{b}+(n+1)\hat{b}^{-1}\right),\ m,n\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq0}\.$$ (3.9)

These are the only singularities of Cbˆb in the complex Pbi plane. Similarly, the ˆc ≤ 1 Virasoro conformal blocks have poles on the real Pbi axis corresponding to degenerate representations of the Virasoro algebra

poles of ${\cal F}$: $$\widehat{P}_{j}=\pm\frac{1}{2}\left((r+1)\hat{b}-(s+1)\hat{b}^{-1}\right),\ r,s\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq0}\;.$$ (3.10)

Together with the poles of the measure, the integrand has then poles for

$$\hat{P}_{j}=\frac{m}{2}\hat{b}+\frac{n}{2}\hat{b}^{-1}\,\ \ (m,n)\in\mathbb{Z}^{2}\setminus\{(0,0)\}\,\tag{3.11}$$

which for ˆb 2 ̸∈ Q is a dense set on the real line.

Since the location of the poles in the internal Liouville momenta are independent of the external Liouville momenta, analytic continuation of the timelike Liouville correlators to complex values of the external momenta Pbext is straightforward, and does not require the further contour deformations that are sometimes needed for analytic continuation of the spacelike Liouville correlators. Indeed, in the Virasoro minimal string we will mostly be interested in the case that the external operators have imaginary timelike Liouville momentum.

The need to shift the OPE contour as described above is perhaps an unfamiliar aspect of timelike Liouville theory. It renders the notion of the spectrum of timelike Liouville somewhat ambiguous, since we may freely deform the OPE contour provided that the poles (3.9), (3.10) on the real axis are avoided. One may wonder about the possibility of different OPE contours. For example, although states with imaginary Liouville momentum are from some points of view natural in timelike Liouville theory, it is clear that with a vertical contour the conformal block decomposition would badly diverge, since with that prescription the OPE would contain internal states with arbitrarily negative conformal dimension. With this prescription where the OPE contour runs parallel to the real axis, the correlation functions of timelike Liouville CFT have been shown to solve the bootstrap equations numerically [40, 78]. Since it satisfies these basic CFT consistency conditions, our view is that despite some subtleties (including non-unitarity of the spectrum) timelike Liouville theory is nonperturbatively well-defined as a CFT in the same sense as spacelike Liouville theory.

The Virasoro minimal string background. Equipped with our knowledge of the OPE data of spacelike and timelike Liouville theories that together with the bc-ghost system defines the worldsheet CFT of the Virasoro minimal string, we can now proceed to compute

![](_page_23_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 5: Contour of integration C over the intermediate states in the Virasoro conformal block decomposition of the genus g n-point function (3.8) in Liouville CFT at ˆc ≤ 1. Poles in the Pb-integrand, coming from the three-point coefficient (3.9) as well as the Virasoro conformal blocks (3.10), are marked with crosses. The contour C runs parallel to the real axis and shifted vertically by a small ε > 0 amount in the imaginary direction in order to avoid the poles. Due to the reflection symmetry of the timelike Liouville structure constant (3.6), the contour C could also be shifted vertically by a small ε < 0.

string worldsheet diagrams as usual in string theory. On-shell vertex operators VP (2.6) are labelled by a single Liouville momentum P and are defined by combining primaries in spacelike and timelike Liouville CFT with the bc-ghosts as in (2.6). In string perturbation theory, the observables are string worldsheet diagrams V (b) g,n(P1, . . . , Pn) ("quantum volumes"), which we define by integrating correlation functions of the worldsheet CFT over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces as outlined in (2.7).

Let us pause to briefly comment on the convergence properties of the moduli integral (2.7) that defines the string worldsheet diagrams that we compute in this paper. In string perturbation theory one often has to worry about divergences in the integrals over worldsheet moduli space that define string diagrams due to intermediate states going on shell. These divergences are associated with particular degenerations in moduli space — for instance, the genus-g worldsheet may split into two components Σg,n → Σg1,n1+1∪Σg2,n2+1 with g = g1+g2 and n = n1 + n2, or in the case of non-separating degenerations, in which a handle pinches and the genus of the worldsheet drops by one but remains connected. The behaviour of the worldsheet integrand near such degenerations is sensitive to the exchange of the lightest operators in the spectrum of the worldsheet CFT. In the Virasoro minimal string theory, the absence of the identity operator (in other words, the non-compact nature of the worldsheet CFT) and the scaling dimensions of the lightest operators in spacelike and timelike Liouville CFT ensure that the resulting moduli integral is in fact absolutely convergent in degenerating limits. We see this explicitly in the case of the torus one-point and sphere four-point diagrams discussed in sections 7.1 and 7.2.

Let us make this more concrete with an example. Consider for instance the moduli integrand in the sphere four-point diagram V (b) 0,4 (P1, . . . , P4), which is computed by integrating the sphere four-point functions of spacelike and timelike Liouville CFT over the complex cross-ratio plane:10

$${\bf V}^{(b)}_{0,4}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{4})=\int_{\mathbb{C}}{\rm d}^{2}z\,\langle V_{P_{1}}\cdots V_{P_{4}}\rangle\langle\widehat{V}_{iP_{1}}\cdots\widehat{V}_{iP_{4}}\rangle.\tag{3.12}$$

We will be interested in the behaviour of the worldsheet integrand in the limit in which two of the vertex operators, say those corresponding to the momenta P1 and P2, coincide. In this degeneration limit the sphere four-point Virasoro blocks can be approximated by the leading term in the small cross-ratio expansion

$${\cal F}^{(b)}_{0,4}({\bf P}^{\rm ext};P|z)\approx z^{P2-P_{1}^{2}-P_{2}^{2}-\frac{Q^{2}}{4}}.\tag{3.13}$$

In this limit the OPE integrals appearing in the spacelike and timelike Liouville four-point functions will be dominated by the P, Pb ≈ 0 regions,11 for which we have

$$\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)\approx16\sqrt{2}\pi^{2}P^{2}.\tag{3.14}$$

Hence we can approximate the sphere four-point functions of spacelike and timelike Liouville CFT as follows in the degeneration limit

$$\langle V_{P_{1}}\cdots V_{P_{4}}\rangle\stackrel{{z\to0}}{{\approx}}\frac{2\pi^{\frac{5}{2}}C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},0)C_{b}(P_{3},P_{4},0)|z|^{-2P_{1}^{2}-2P_{2}^{2}-\frac{Q^{2}}{2}}}{(-\log|z|)^{\frac{3}{2}}}$$ $$\langle\widehat{V}_{iP_{1}}\cdots\widehat{V}_{iP_{4}}\rangle\stackrel{{z\to0}}{{\approx}}\frac{|z|^{2P_{1}^{2}+2P_{2}^{2}+\frac{Q^{2}}{2}}}{64\pi^{\frac{3}{2}}(-\log|z|)^{\frac{1}{2}}C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},0)C_{b}(P_{3},P_{4},0)}.\tag{3.15a}$$

In particular the product of four-point functions that appears in the moduli integrand has the following behaviour in the degeneration limit

$$\langle V_{P_{1}}\cdots V_{P_{4}}\rangle\langle\widehat{V}_{iP_{1}}\cdots\widehat{V}_{iP_{4}}\rangle\stackrel{{z\to0}}{{\approx}}\frac{\pi|z|^{-2}}{32(-\log|z|)^{2}}\,\tag{3.16}$$

and thus the moduli integral (3.12) receives convergent contributions from the degeneration limit locally of the form

$$\int_{\mathbb{C}}\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}z}{|z|^{2}(-\log|z|)^{2}}.\tag{3.17}$$

<sup>10</sup>In what follows we will typically omit the explicit dependence on the worldsheet moduli of the worldsheet CFT correlators for brevity of notation. For example below we have ⟨VP1 · · · VP4 ⟩ = ⟨VP1 (0)VP2 (z)VP3 (1)VP4 (∞)⟩.

<sup>11</sup>Here we are assuming that the external Liouville momenta are such that the contour in the conformal block decomposition does not need to be deformed. This is always the case for real Liouville momenta.

Similar considerations apply to all other degeneration limits of the sphere four-point diagram (which can be studied exactly analogously by working in different OPE channels), and to degeneration limits of more complicated observables. It is interesting to compare eq. (3.16) with the leading behaviour of the Weil-Petersson volume form, which appears in JT gravity. Using the explicit form ωWP = dℓ ∧ dθ of the Weil-Petersson form in Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates [81] and the leading relation

$$\ell\sim\frac{2\pi^{2}}{-\log|z|}\,\qquad\frac{2\pi\theta}{\ell}\sim\arg(z)\tag{3.18}$$

between z and the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates, gives the leading behaviour [82]

$$\omega_{\rm WP}\sim\frac{8\pi^{3}i\,{\rm d}z\wedge{\rm d}\bar{z}}{|z|^{2}(-\log|z|)^{3}}\,\tag{3.19}$$

which is slightly faster decaying than (3.16).

A trivial worldsheet diagram. As a trivial example, let us consider the three-punctured sphere. In this case there are no moduli to integrate over, and the three-point diagram is simply given by the product of the corresponding structure constants in spacelike and timelike Liouville theory given by (3.1) and (3.6) respectively. On the solution to the massshell condition (2.5) the sphere three-point diagram is then simply given by

$${\sf V}_{0,3}^{(b)}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3})\equiv C_{\rm S^{2}}\langle{\cal V}_{P_{1}}(0){\cal V}_{P_{2}}(1){\cal V}_{P_{3}}(\infty)\rangle\tag{3.20}$$ $$=C_{\rm S^{2}}{\sf N}(P_{1}){\sf N}(P_{2}){\sf N}(P_{3})C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3})\widehat{C}_{b}(iP_{1},iP_{2},iP_{3})$$ $$=C_{\rm S^{2}}{\sf N}(P_{1}){\sf N}(P_{2}){\sf N}(P_{3})\,\frac{C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3})}{C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3})}$$ $$=C_{\rm S^{2}}{\sf N}(P_{1}){\sf N}(P_{2}){\sf N}(P_{3})\,$$

where we have used the relation between the structure constants of timelike and spacelike Liouville given in (3.6) together with reflection invariance of Cb. Here, CS2 reflects the arbitrary normalization of the string path integral.

We fix the arbitrary normalizations N(P) of the vertex operators by requiring that

${\rm V}_{0,3}^{(b)}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3})\stackrel{{!}}{{=}}1$, (3.21)

which implies that N(P) ≡ N is independent of P and

$C_{\rm S^{2}}={\rm N}^{-3}$.

### 3.2 Worldsheet boundary conditions

In order to discuss configurations with asymptotic boundaries we need to supplement the worldsheet CFT with conformal boundary conditions. Here we review the conformal boundary conditions of spacelike and timelike Liouville CFT, and describe their role in the worldsheet description of configurations with asymptotic boundaries in Virasoro minimal string theory. Throughout we emphasize the definition of the conformal boundary conditions in terms of abstract boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) data rather than in terms of specific boundary conditions for the Liouville fields in the Lagrangian descriptions of the theories.

#### Conformal boundary conditions for spacelike Liouville

Spacelike Liouville CFT admits two main types of conformal boundary conditions, whose properties we summarize in turn.

ZZ boundary conditions. The first are the ZZ boundary conditions [83], which are labelled by a degenerate representation of the Virasoro algebra. In defining conformal boundary conditions, it is convenient to map the upper half-plane to the unit disk by a conformal transformation so that the boundary condition defines a state in the Hilbert space of the CFT on the circle by the usual radial quantization. The ZZ boundary states can be represented in terms of the Ishibashi states |VP ⟩⟩ associated with the primaries in the spectrum as follows12

$${\rm ZZ}^{(b)}_{(m,n)}\rangle=\int_{0}^{\infty}\!{\rm d}P\,\rho^{(b)}_{0}(P)\Psi^{(b)}_{(m,n)}(P)|V_{P}\rangle\rangle.\tag{3.23}$$

The quantity Ψ(b) (m,n) (P), which we will specify shortly, is the disk one-point function of the primary VP in the presence of the (m, n) ZZ boundary condition.

Consider the annulus formed by cutting a circle of radius e−πt out of the unit disk, with Ishibashi states |VP1 ⟩⟩ and |VP2 ⟩⟩ on the inner and outer boundary circles respectively. This configuration corresponds by the usual exponential map to the following partition function on a cylinder with unit radius and length πt:

$$\langle\!\langle V_{P_{1}}|{\rm e}^{-\pi t(L_{0}+\bar{L}_{0}-\frac{\pi}{12})}|V_{P_{2}}\rangle\!\rangle=\frac{\delta(P_{1}-P_{2})+\delta(P_{1}+P_{2})}{\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P_{1})}\,\chi_{P_{1}}^{(b)}(it)\,\tag{3.24}$$

<sup>12</sup>The convention of including ρ (b) 0 (P) in the measure of the integral over P is natural in our normalization of Liouville theory. This will also lead to analytic expressions for the wave-functions, contrary to the perhaps more familiar conventions from the literature.

where

$$\chi^{(b)}_{P}(\tau)=\frac{q^{P^{2}}}{\eta(\tau)}\,\quad q={\rm e}^{2\pi{\rm i}\tau}\tag{3.25}$$

is the non-degenerate Virasoro character associated with a primary of conformal weight hP . The ZZ boundary states are defined by the property that the cylinder partition function with the (m, n) and (1, 1) boundary conditions assigned to the two ends is given by the corresponding Virasoro character in the open string channel [83]

$$\langle{\rm ZZ}^{(b)}_{(m,n)}|\,{\rm e}^{-\pi t(L_{0}+\hat{L}_{0}-\frac{\kappa}{2\pi})}\,|{\rm ZZ}^{(b)}_{(1,1)}\rangle=\int_{0}^{\infty}{\rm d}P\,\rho^{(b)}_{0}(P)\Psi^{(b)}_{(m,n)}(P)\Psi^{(b)}_{(1,1)}(P)\chi^{(b)}_{P}(it)\tag{3.26}$$ $$\stackrel{{!}}{{=}}\chi^{(b)}_{(m,n)}(\frac{i}{t})$$ $$={\rm Tr}\,_{{\cal H}_{(m,n)}(i,1)}{\rm e}^{-\frac{2\pi}{\hbar}(L_{0}-\frac{\kappa}{2\pi})}\,$$

with

$$\chi^{(b)}_{(m,n)}(\tau)=\frac{q^{-\frac{1}{4}(mb+nb^{-1})^{2}}-q^{-\frac{1}{4}(mb-nb^{-1})^{2}}}{\eta(\tau)}\,,\quad q=\mathrm{e}^{2\pi i\tau}\tag{3.27}$$

the torus character of the (m, n) degenerate representation of the Virasoro algebra. This fixes the bulk one-point functions to be

$$\Psi^{(b)}_{(m,n)}(P)=\frac{4\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi mbP)\sinh(2\pi nb^{-1}P)}{\rho^{(b)}_{0}(P)}.\tag{3.28}$$

In particular we have Ψ(b) (1,1)(P) = 1, for which the cylinder partition function is the Virasoro identity character in the open-string channel. In the last line of (3.26) we have reminded the reader that the cylinder partition function admits an interpretation in terms of a trace over the Hilbert space of the CFT on the strip with thermal circle of size 2π t . The more general cylinder partition function with mixed ZZ boundary conditions is given by the following sum over degenerate Virasoro characters in the open string channel [83]

$$\langle{\rm ZZ}^{(b)}_{(m,n)}|\,{\rm e}^{-\pi t(L_{0}+\bar{L}_{0}-\frac{c}{2\pi})}\,|{\rm ZZ}^{(b)}_{(m^{\prime},n^{\prime})}\rangle=\sum_{r^{2}|m-m^{\prime}|+1}^{m+m^{\prime}-1}\sum_{s^{2}|n-m^{\prime}|+1}^{n+m^{\prime}-1}\chi^{(b)}_{(r,s)}(\frac{i}{t})\,\tag{3.29}$$

where the notation 2= is meant to indicate that the variable increases in steps of 2.

FZZT boundary conditions. Spacelike Liouville theory also admits a distinct oneparameter family of conformal boundaries known as the FZZT boundary conditions [84,85]. It is described by the following boundary state

$${\rm FZZT}^{(b)}(s)\rangle=\int_{0}^{\infty}{\rm d}P\,\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)\Psi^{(b)}(s;P)|V_{P}\rangle\rangle.\tag{3.30}$$

The FZZT parameter s takes real values. Indeed we will see that it labels a state in the spectrum of Liouville theory. The FZZT boundary state is defined such that the Hilbert space of Liouville CFT on the strip with FZZT boundary conditions on one end and (1, 1) ZZ boundary conditions on the other is spanned by a single primary state labelled by the Liouville momentum s. Indeed, the mixed cylinder partition function is given by a single non-degenerate Virasoro character in the open-string channel

$$\langle{\rm ZZ}^{(b)}_{(1,1)}|{\rm e}^{-\pi t(L_{0}+L_{0}-\frac{c}{\hbar})}|{\rm FZZT}^{(b)}(s)\rangle=\int_{0}^{\infty}{\rm d}P\,\rho^{(b)}_{0}(P)\Psi^{(b)}_{(1,1)}(P)\Psi^{(b)}(s;P)\chi^{(b)}_{P}(it)\tag{3.31}$$ $$\stackrel{{!}}{{=}}\chi^{(b)}_{s}(\stackrel{{!}}{{t}})\.$$

Hence the FZZT bulk one-point function Ψ(b) (s; P) is given by

$$\Psi^{(b)}(s;P)=\frac{\mathbb{S}_{sP}[1]}{\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)}=\frac{2\sqrt{2}\cos(4\pi sP)}{\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)}.\tag{3.32}$$

Here S[1] is the crossing kernel for Virasoro characters on the torus.

In what follows the partition function of Liouville CFT on the cylinder with FZZT boundary conditions at the two ends will play an important role. It is given by

$$\langle{\rm FZZT}^{(b)}(s_{1})|{\rm e}^{-\pi{\rm i}(L_{0}+L_{0}-\frac{\epsilon}{12})}|{\rm FZZT}^{(b)}(s_{2})\rangle=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Gamma}{\rm d}P\,\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)\Psi^{(b)}(s_{1};P)\Psi^{(b)}(s_{2};P)\chi_{P}^{(b)}(it)\tag{3.33}$$ $$=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\int_{\Gamma}{\rm d}P\,\frac{\cos(4\pi s_{1}P)\cos(4\pi s_{2}P)}{\sinh(2\pi bP)\sinh(2\pi b-1P)}\,\chi_{P}^{(b)}(it)\.$$

Here we have promoted the integral over the positive P axis to a horizontal contour Γ in the complex P plane that avoids the pole of the integrand at the origin. Since the residue at P = 0 vanishes, it does not matter whether the contour passes above or below 0. The open string spectrum consists of a continuum of states with weights above the c−1 24 threshold.

#### Conformal boundary conditions for timelike Liouville

When we add boundaries to the worldsheet in Virasoro minimal string theory we will pair particular conformal boundaries for the spacelike Liouville sector with those of the timelike Liouville sector. Conformal boundary conditions for timelike Liouville CFT have been relatively unexplored compared to their spacelike counterparts (see however [86]). Here we will introduce a new family of ZZ-like boundary conditions for timelike Liouville CFT that will play a distinguished role in the Virasoro minimal string. Before moving on, let us emphasize that conformal boundaries of non-unitary and non-compact CFTs are relatively weakly constrained13 and thus it is a priori not particularly clear what wavefunctions should be allowed. Nevertheless, we find the following boundary condition very natural.

"Half-ZZ" boundary conditions. Consider the following boundary states for timelike Liouville CFT

$$\widehat{\cal Z}^{(i\bar{b})}_{(m,\pm)}\rangle=\int_{\cal C}{\rm d}\widehat{P}\,\frac{(i\bar{P})^{2}}{2\rho_{0}^{(\bar{b})}(i\widehat{P})}\widehat{\Psi}^{(i\bar{b})}_{(m,\pm)}(\widehat{P})|\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}}\rangle\rangle\,\tag{3.34}$$

where |Vb Pb⟩⟩ is the Ishibashi state associated to the primary Vb Pb in the spectrum of timelike Liouville CFT, normalized such that

$$\langle\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{1}}|e^{-\pi t(L_{0}+L_{0}-\frac{i}{\hbar^{2}})}|\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{2}}\rangle\rangle=\frac{2\rho_{0}^{(\widehat{b})}(i\widehat{P})}{(i\widehat{P})^{2}}\left(\delta(\widehat{P}_{1}-\widehat{P}_{2})+\delta(\widehat{P}_{1}+\widehat{P}_{2})\right)\chi_{p}^{(\widehat{b})}(it).\tag{3.35}$$

In (3.34) we have again included the measure that descends from the two-point function of timelike Liouville CFT (see e.g. (3.8)), which is natural in our normalization. The contour is also the same as appears in section 3.1 and that avoids all the poles on the real line, C = R + iε. The corresponding conformal boundary conditions come in two infinite families, labelled by a positive integer m ∈ Z≥1 and a sign. We declare that the bulk one-point functions on the disk Ψb(iˆb) (m,±) are given by14

$$\widehat{\Psi}^{(i\hat{b})}_{(m,\pm)}(\widehat{P})=\frac{4\sin(2\pi m\hat{b}^{\pm1}\widehat{P})}{\widehat{P}}.\tag{3.36}$$

In what follows we will refer to these as "half-ZZ" boundary conditions. The reason for the "half-ZZ" name is that the product of the (m, +) and (n, −) wavefunctions (3.36) is functionally similar (but not identical) to that of the (m, n) ordinary ZZ boundary conditions (3.28) adapted to timelike Liouville CFT with ˆc ≤ 1.

In order to assess these boundary states, we scrutinize the cylinder partition functions associated with them. In particular, consider the cylinder partition function with (m, +)

<sup>13</sup>Here we mean that in non-compact and non-unitary CFT, in implementing the cylinder bootstrap the spectrum in the open-string channel is a priori not subject to the usual constraints of positivity, discreteness, and integrality. Nevertheless we will see that the cylinder partition functions involving the conformal boundary conditions that we will introduce obey these properties.

<sup>14</sup>Here the ± on the RHS is correlated to that on the LHS; it does not mean the product of the expressions with each sign, as was the case in (3.1).

half-ZZ boundary conditions on one end and (n, +) on the other. It is given by

Z (iˆb) (m,+;n,+)(t) = ⟨ZZc(iˆb) (m,+)|e −πt(L0+L¯0− cˆ 12 ) |ZZc(iˆb) (n,+)⟩ = Z C dPb (iPb) 2 2ρ (ˆb) 0 (iPb) Z C dPb′ (iPb′ ) 2 2ρ (ˆb) 0 (iPb′ ) Ψb(iˆb) (m,+)(Pb)Ψb(iˆb) (n,+)(Pb′ )⟨⟨Vb Pb|e −πt(L0+L¯0− cˆ 12 ) |Vb Pb′⟩⟩ = Z C dPb (iPb) 2 2ρ (ˆb) 0 (iPb) Ψb(iˆb) (m,+)(Pb)Ψb(iˆb) (n,+)(Pb)χ (iˆb) Pb (it) = mX +n−1 r 2=|m−n|+1 X∞ s 2=1 χ (iˆb) (r,s) ( i t ) . (3.37)

The result takes the form of an infinite sum over degenerate characters of the central charge cˆ Virasoro algebra in the open-string channel. The structure of degenerate representations of the ˆc ≤ 1 Virasoro algebra is such that this sum is actually convergent. Indeed, the cylinder partition function (3.37) is formally equivalent to that of spacelike Liouville CFT with (m, ∞) and (n, ∞) ordinary ZZ boundary conditions analytically continued to ˆc ≤ 1.15 Analogously, we have

$$Z^{(ib)}_{(m,-;n,-)}(t)=\sum_{r\stackrel{{\mbox{\scriptsize$\geq$}}}{{=}}1}^{\infty}\sum_{s\stackrel{{\mbox{\scriptsize$\geq$}}}{{=}}|m-n|+1}^{m+n-1}\chi^{(ib)}_{(r,s)}(\frac{i}{t}).\tag{3.38}$$

A very similar calculation yields the following for the cylinder partition function in timelike Liouville theory with (m, +) and (n, −) half-ZZ boundary conditions

$$Z^{(ib)}_{(m_{i}+n_{i},-)}(t)=\langle\widetilde{Z}\widetilde{Z}^{(ib)}_{(m_{i}+)}|{\rm e}^{-\pi t(L_{0}+L_{0}-\frac{t}{12})}|\widetilde{Z}\widetilde{Z}^{(ib)}_{(n_{i}-)}\rangle=\sum_{\begin{subarray}{c}r_{-2}^{2}-m+1\end{subarray}}^{m-1}\sum_{s_{-}^{2}-n+1}^{n-1}\chi^{(ib)}_{\widetilde{P}=\frac{1}{2}(rb-\delta^{-1})}(\frac{t}{t}).\tag{3.39}$$

The result involves a finite sum over certain non-degenerate Virasoro characters in the openstring channel (some of which involve conformal weights equal to those of particular degenerate representations of the Virasoro algebra).

Timelike Liouville CFT presumably also admits a suitable generalization of the FZZT boundary conditions [86], which are conceptually similar to those of spacelike Liouville theory that were discussed in section 3.2. In this paper we will not make use of FZZT boundary conditions for timelike Liouville CFT and so we will not discuss them any further here.

<sup>15</sup>However for spacelike Liouville theory, the sum over degenerate characters would diverge.

## 4 A three-dimensional perspective

In this section, we give a conceptual derivation of the proposed duality. Our arguments will heavily involve a connection to a chiral half of three-dimensional gravity on the topology Σg,n × S 1 .

#### 4.1 3d gravity on Σg,n × S 1

We consider three-dimensional quantum gravity with negative cosmological constant. Let Σg,n be an initial-value surface of genus g with n punctures. Then it is known that the Hilbert space of 3d gravity on Σg,n can be identified with Hgravity = Hg,n ⊗ Hg,n, where Hg,n is the space of Virasoro conformal blocks with all internal conformal weights above the c−1 24 threshold [87, 88]. Since these are precisely the conformal blocks that appear in Liouville theory, we will often adopt "Liouville conformal blocks" as a shorthand. The central charge of the Liouville theory is given by the Brown-Henneaux central charge c, which is an arbitrary parameter of the theory. As in the rest of the paper, we take c ≥ 25. Insertions of vertex operators on Σg,n correspond to massive particles in the three-dimensional picture (for conformal weights h ≤ c−1 24 ) and to black holes (for conformal weight h > c−1 24 ).

In ordinary 3d gravity, we take the central charge of the two factors Hg,n to be equal, but we can also consider the case where the right-moving central charge ¯c is different. In particular, the relation to 2d gravity will appear in a chiral version of gravity, where ¯c = 0. In this case, we can remove one factor of the Hilbert space and simply take a chiral half

${\cal H}_{g,n}=$ space of Liouville conformal blocks . (4.1)

We can endow this space with an inner product to turn it into a Hilbert space. Letting F1 and F2 be two Liouville conformal blocks, we have schematically [87, 88]

$$\langle{\cal F}_{1}\,|\,{\cal F}_{2}\rangle=\int_{{\cal T}_{g,n}}\,\overline{{\cal F}}_{1}\,{\cal F}_{2}\,Z_{\rm tL}\,Z_{\rm gh}\,\,,\tag{4.2}$$

where ZtL is the partition function of timelike Liouville theory of central charge 26−c. Zgh is the bc-ghost partition function as in string theory that provides the measure to integrate over Teichm¨uller space Tg,n. Let us recall that Teichm¨uller space is the universal covering space of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces Mg,n. Since the conformal blocks are not crossing symmetric it would not make sense to restrict this integral to moduli space. However, just like in string theory, the total central charge needs to equal 26 for the Weyl anomaly to cancel. In the presence of punctures ZtL should be thought of as a correlation function in timelike Liouville theory, where the vertex operators are chosen such that all the combined external conformal weights sum to one.

Only Liouville conformal blocks are (delta-function) normalizable with respect to this inner product. In fact, there is an explicit formula for this inner product [88]. For the four-punctured sphere, it takes the following form16

$$\langle{\cal F}^{(b)}_{0,4}({\bf P}^{\rm ext};P)\,|\,{\cal F}^{(b)}_{0,4}({\bf P}^{\rm ext};P^{\prime})\rangle=\frac{\rho^{(b)}_{0}(P)^{-1}\,\delta(P-P^{\prime})}{C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},P)C_{b}(P_{3},P_{4},P)}\,\tag{4.3}$$

where we assumed the two conformal blocks to be in the same OPE channel. We also wrote Pext = (P1, P2, P3, P4). Here and throughout we use the notation | F(b) g,n(Pext; P)⟩ for the states in Hg,n whose wavefunction at some fixed value of the moduli m is given by F (b) g,n(Pext; P|m). More generally, we get a factor of Cb(Pj , Pk, Pl) −1 for every threepunctured sphere appearing in the pair-of-pants decomposition of the conformal block and a factor of ρ (b) 0 (P) −1 for every cuff. This is precisely the inverse of the OPE density of spacelike Liouville theory, for which we summarized our conventions in section 3.1 and appendix C. This formula can be derived in a variety of ways [88]. It is for example fully fixed up to overall normalization by requiring that crossing transformations on conformal blocks act unitarily.

The inner product (4.2) is tantalizingly close to the integral that we want to compute for the two-dimensional theory of gravity under consideration. In fact, it tells us about the integral over Teichm¨uller space of the worldsheet partition/correlation function before integrating over the internal Liouville momenta. Let us make this a bit more precise as follows. Recall that the moduli space of Riemann surfaces is the quotient of Teichm¨uller space by the mapping class group. For example, in the simplest case of a once-punctured torus, this mapping class group is simply given by the group of modular transformations Map(Σ1,1) = SL(2, Z). There is a subgroup of the mapping class group Map(Σg,n) generated by Dehn twists around the curves used to define the pair of pants decomposition. It is an abelian group Z 3g−3+n . The conformal blocks transform with a simple phase e2πihP under such a Dehn twist, where P denotes the Liouville momentum through the curve around which we perform the Dehn twist. In particular, this phase cancels once one combines the left- and right-movers. We consider the case of the four-punctured sphere for simplicity. Then we have the following integral identity (we suppress the ghosts in the notation)

$$\int_{{\cal T}_{0,4}/\mathbb{Z}}\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},P)C_{b}(P_{3},P_{4},P)\big{|}{\cal F}_{0,4}^{(b)}({\bf P}^{\rm ext};P|z)\big{|}^{2}\left\langle\prod_{j=1}^{4}\widehat{V}_{iP_{j}}(z_{j})\right\rangle=2P.\tag{4.4}$$

This equation follows from eq. (4.3) as follows. Consider P close to P ′ . Then we can write

<sup>16</sup>This formula implicitly sets a convention for the normalization of the ghost partition function.

the integral over Teichm¨uller space that defines the inner product (4.2) as follows:

ρ (b) 0 (P) −1 δ(P − P ′ ) Cb(P1, P2, P)Cb(P3, P4, P) = X n∈Z e 2πin(hP −hP ′ ) Z T0,4/Z F (b) 0,4 (Pext; P|z) F (b) 0,4 (P ext; P ′ |z) Y 4 j=1 VbiPj (zj ) = δ(hP − hP′) Z T0,4/Z F (b) 0,4 (Pext; P|z) F (b) 0,4 (P ext; P ′ |z) Y 4 j=1 VbiPj (zj ) . (4.5)

In the first line, we chopped up the integral over Teichm¨uller space. We made some arbitrary choice of fundamental domain in the integration over T0,4/Z and used that the conformal blocks transform simply under Dehn twists. We can now strip off the delta-function and compare the coefficients. Since hP = c−1 24 + P 2 , we have (recall that we assume P, P′ ≥ 0):

$$\delta(h_{P}-h_{P^{\prime}})=\delta(P^{2}-(P^{\prime})^{2})=\frac{1}{2P}\delta(P-P^{\prime}).\tag{4.6}$$

Thus (4.4) follows.

Coming back to the chiral half of 3d gravity, the partition function on a 3-manifold of the form Σg,n × S 1 can be formally obtained as follows

ZΣg,n×S1 = 1 |Map(Σg,n)| dim Hg,n = 1 |Map(Σg,n)| Z d 3g−3+nP tr |F(b) g,n(Pext; P)⟩⟨F(b) g,n(Pext; P)| ⟨F(b) g,n(Pext; P)| F(b) g,n(Pext; P)⟩ = 1 |Map(Σg,n)| Z d 3g−3+nP Y a ρ (b) 0 (Pa) Y (j,k,l) Cb(Pj , Pk, Pl) × Z Tg,n  F (b) g,n(P ext; P|m)   2 Yn j=1 VbiPj (zj ) g Zgh = 1 |Map(Σg,n)| Z Tg,n Yn j=1 VPj (zj ) g Yn j=1 VbiPj (zj ) g Zgh = Z Mg,n Yn j=1 VPj (zj ) g Yn j=1 VbiPj (zj ) g Zgh = V (b) g,n(P1, . . . , Pn) . (4.7)

Here we used that the mapping class group Map(Σg,n) is gauged in gravity and that the three-dimensional mapping class group on Σg,n × S 1 coincides with the two-dimensional one. We have by definition Mg,n = Tg,n/Map(Σg,n). We also used that the Hamiltonian of gravity vanishes and the partition function before dividing by the mapping class group is simply given by the (infinite) dimension of the Hilbert space. We wrote this dimension as a trace of the identity, which we in turn wrote by inserting a complete set of conformal blocks, for which we used a braket notation to emphasize that they span the Hilbert space. By the inner product ⟨F(b) g,n|F(b) g,n⟩ in the second line of (4.7), we mean the coefficient of the delta-function appearing in (4.3). We then use the formula in terms of an integral over Teichm¨uller space (4.2) in the numerator and the explicit formula (4.3) in the denominator. We recognize the conformal block expansion of the spacelike Liouville correlation function in the third line of the above equation (4.7). Finally, we can gauge the mapping class group by using the crossing symmetry of the spacelike Liouville correlation function and restrict the integral to moduli space Mg,n. We thus reach the conclusion that the 2d gravity partition functions that we want to study are nothing else but the partition functions of chiral gravity on Σg,n × S 1 . Punctures in the 2d theory become Wilson lines in the 3d gravity theory that wrap the thermal circle.

Some comments are in order. First, the reader may worry that this derivation was a bit formal, since both the integral over Teichm¨uller space diverges and Map(Σg,n) is an infinite group. There are however several ways to get around this. For example, the inner product (4.2) can be derived from the path integral of 3d gravity, see [87]. Gauging of Map(Σg,n) in that path integral indeed reduces the integral to the quotient Mg,n = Tg,n/Map(Σg,n). Thus we could have gauged Map(Σg,n) from the very beginning and the gravity path integral can be brought to the form (4.7), thus circumventing the formal step in our argument. One can also compute equivariantly with respect to Map(Σg,n). The Hilbert space carries an action of the mapping class group that acts by crossing and while there are infinitely many conformal blocks, one can decompose the Hilbert space into irreducible representations of Map(Σg,n) and every irreducible representation appears only finitely many times. This removes the formal infinities appearing in the problem.

Second, the partition function appearing in (4.7) has no reason to be a positive integer. This is perhaps confusing since we would have expected that the gravity partition function would count the number of states of the Hilbert space obtained after dividing by Map(Σg,n). Such a chiral gravity theory can indeed be defined. However it differs in a rather subtle way from what we discuss here. To define it, one starts from a compactified phase space Mg,n, but the theory explicitly depends on the chosen compactification. Consistency then requires that the framing anomalies of the theory cancel, which imposes c ∈ 24Z and h ∈ Z. Moreover, since Mg,n has orbifold singularities, one needs to include contributions from twisted sectors. Such a theory is discussed in [89]. However, since we do not insist on a fully three-dimensional interpretation, we do not have to worry that these partition functions are non integer-valued.

### 4.2 Quantization and index theorem

We will now discuss an alternative way to compute the chiral gravity partition function on Σg,n × S 1 , which will make contact with the intersection theory on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. This discussion follows closely [89,90]. Let us again start with the phase space of gravity, which is given by Tg,n (or Mg,n if we want to divide by Map(Σg,n) before quantization). The symplectic form on Tg,n is the Weil-Petersson form c 48π2 ωWP(ℓ1, . . . , ℓn). In the case that punctures are present, the external conformal weights hj are related to the lengths of the geodesic boundaries of the Weil-Petersson form as follows:

$$h_{j}=\frac{c}{24}\left(1+\frac{\ell_{j}^{2}}{4\pi^{2}}\right).\tag{4.8}$$

To pass to the quantum theory, we want to quantize this phase space. Since Teichm¨uller space is a K¨ahler manifold, a convenient way of doing so is to use K¨ahler quantization. The result is that the wavefunctions are holomorphic sections of a line bundle L over Teichm¨uller space whose curvature is

$$c_{1}({\cal L})=\frac{c}{48\pi^{2}}\,\omega_{\rm WP}(\ell_{1},\ldots,\ell_{n}).\tag{4.9}$$

Holomorphic sections of this line bundle can be identified with Liouville conformal blocks which lead to the description of the Hilbert space discussed above. The non-triviality of the line bundle is an expression of the conformal anomaly, since conformal blocks are not functions of the moduli; this is only true after fixing an explicit metric, i.e. trivialization of the bundle. Of course, Tg,n is a contractible space and thus we could trivialize this line bundle (in a non-canonical way). However, this will not be true once we restrict to moduli space and thus it is important to keep the curvature at this point.

We can then compute the partition function of chiral gravity on Σg,n×S 1 by counting the number of holomorphic sections of this line bundle. It can be computed from the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch index theorem:

$$\dim{\cal H}_{g,n}=\int_{{\cal T}_{g,n}}{\rm td}({\cal T}_{g,n})\,{\rm e}^{\frac{G}{48\pi^{2}}\omega_{\rm WP}(\ell_{1},...,\ell_{n})}.\tag{4.10}$$

Here, td denotes the Todd class of the tangent bundle. Thus the partition function of 3d gravity may be computed by restricting this divergent integral to moduli space:

$$Z_{\Sigma_{g,n}\times{\rm S}^{1}}=\int_{{\cal M}_{g,n}}{\rm td}({\cal M}_{g,n})\,{\rm e}^{\frac{c}{48\pi^{2}}\omega_{\rm WP}(\ell_{1},...,\ell_{n})}.\tag{4.11}$$

We used that the tangent bundle of moduli space has the same curvature as the tangent bundle of Teichm¨uller space and thus the characteristic classes agree. We can then extend the integral to Mg,n and treat the integrand as cohomology classes. Using that the cohomology class of the Weil-Petersson form is given by (A.6) and the relation of the lengths and conformal weights (4.8), we arrive at eq. (2.20).

This computation contains the same formal infinities as before. However, this is again not a problem. We could have used an equivariant version of the index theorem to render the expressions well-defined. We also remark that the proof of the index theorem via the heat kernel is a local computation which is unaffected by the compactness of the manifold.

Thus, we arrive at a central claim of the paper, namely

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})=\int_{{\cal M}_{g,n}}{\rm td}({\cal M}_{g,n})\,{\rm e}^{\frac{c}{24}\kappa_{1}+\sum_{j=1}^{n}(P_{j}^{2}-\frac{1}{24})\psi_{j}}\,\,\,.\tag{4.12}$$

We recall the definition of the ψ- and κ-classes for the benefit of the reader in appendix A. We also extended the integral to the Deligne-Mumford compactification of Mg,n in order to use the standard intersection theory on moduli space.

We can then use the following formula for the Todd class of the tangent bundle:

$${\rm td}({\cal M}_{g,n})=\exp\left(-\frac{13}{24}\kappa_{1}+\frac{1}{24}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\psi_{j}-\sum_{m\geq1}\frac{B_{2m}}{(2m)(2m)!}\kappa_{2m}\right)\,,\tag{4.13}$$

where B2m are the Bernoulli numbers. This formula was derived in [89] for the tangent bundle of Mg,n. The two formulas differ slightly, because the treatment of the boundary divisor is different. It is clear that the formula of interest should not get contributions from boundary divisors since it is obtained by restricting an integrand on Tg,n. To derive this formula, one applies the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem to the forgetful map Mg,n+1 −→ Mg,n and the line bundle of quadratic differentials on the Riemann surface, which in turn span the cotangent space of Mg,n. This application is standard in algebraic geometry, see e.g. [91] for a general context. We thus obtain

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})=\int_{\overline{\cal M}_{g,n}}\exp\left(\frac{c-13}{24}\kappa_{1}+\sum_{j=1}^{n}P_{j}^{2}\psi_{j}-\sum_{m\geq1}\frac{B_{2m}}{(2m)(2m)!}\,\kappa_{2m}\right).\tag{4.14}$$

This reproduces eq. (2.20). Similar generalizations of the Weil-Petersson volumes from an intersection point of view were considered for example in [92]. This establishes the links between the worldsheet formulation, 3d gravity and the intersection theory on Mg,n as depicted in figure 1.

### 4.3 Dilaton and string equation

Fully analyzing (4.14) requires fairly deep mathematics in the form of topological recursion, which we will discuss in section 5.3. However, it is more straightforward to deduce two simpler equations for the quantum volumes directly. Borrowing terminology from topological gravity, we call them the dilaton and the string equation. We already wrote them down without further explanation in eqs. (2.21a) and (2.21b) and repeat them here

V (b) g,n+1(P = iQb 2 , P) − V (b) g,n+1(P = iQ 2 , P) = (2g − 2 + n)V (b) g,n(P) , (4.15a)

$$\int_{\frac{l_{0}^{2}}{2}}^{\frac{l_{0}^{2}}{2}}2P\,{\rm d}P\;{\sf V}_{g,n+1}^{(b)}(P,{\bf P})=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\int_{0}^{P_{j}}2P_{j}\,{\rm d}P_{j}\;{\sf V}_{g,n}^{(b)}({\bf P})\;.\tag{4.15b}$$

The reason for the existence of these equations is that one can integrate out the location of the (n+1)-st marked point of the integrand on the LHS. In the language of the cohomology of the moduli space, this is implemented by the pushforward in cohomology. Let

$$\pi:\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n+1}\longrightarrow\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}\tag{4.16}$$

be the map between moduli spaces that forgets the location of the (n + 1)-st marked point. Then integrating over its location is given by the pushforward

$$\pi_{*}:{\rm H}^{\bullet}({\cal M}_{g,n+1},{\mathbb{C}})\longrightarrow{\rm H}^{\bullet-2}({\cal M}_{g,n},{\mathbb{C}}).\tag{4.17}$$

In appendix D, we show that the integrands of the dilaton and string equation (4.15a) and (4.15b) are simple to pushforward and the result can again be expressed in terms of the cohomology classes of the integrand for the quantum volumes. Integrating over Mg,n then gives the two equations. We refer the reader to appendix D for details.

### 4.4 Disk and trumpet partition functions

The 3d gravity point of view is very useful to understand the meaning of asymptotic boundaries, since an asymptotically (nearly) AdS2 boundary uplifts simply to an asymptotically AdS3 boundary.

The simplest topology with an asymptotic boundary is the disk D2 , for which the corresponding 3d topology is a solid cylinder. From the point of view of chiral gravity, it is thus clear that ZD2×S1 evaluates to the vacuum Virasoro character of the boundary torus, see e.g. [93]. The vacuum Virasoro character depends on the thermal length β˜ of S1 . It is related by a modular transformation to the boundary circle of the disk, which plays the role of time in the dual matrix model of our two-dimensional gravity theory. We thus set β = 4π 2 β˜ . This recovers (2.16a). A similar argument determines the trumpet partition function (2.16b).

They can also directly be derived from the integral (4.12) over moduli space. The relevant moduli space for the disk is the Virasoro coadjoint orbit Diff(S1 )/PSL(2, R), where PSL(2, R) corresponds to the three reparametrization modes of the disk. Quantization of the phase space Diff(S1 )/PSL(2, R) is thus achieved by quantizing Virasoro coadjoint orbits which leads again to Virasoro characters [94]. Finally, the integral (4.12) over Diff(S1 )/PSL(2, R) can also be performed equivariantly, where β enters as an equivariant parameter. One can then use equivariant localization to compute it directly. We refer to [89, 95] for details on this. Similarly the trumpet partition function is obtained by the quantization of a generic Virasoro coadjoint orbit Diff(S1 )/S 1 .

It now also follows that one can glue the trumpet partition function to the bulk part of the two-dimensional geometry as in JT gravity. We already determined the correct gluing measure 2P dP in eq. (4.4). Indeed, when gluing a trumpet, the geodesic where we are gluing the trumpet is unique and is in particular preserved by any mapping class group transformation. Thus the only mapping class group transformation interacting non-trivially with the trumpets are Dehn twists along the gluing geodesic and hence taking the Z quotient as in (4.4) reduces the integral over Teichm¨uller space to an integral over moduli space. Of course there can be still non-trivial mapping class group transformations acting only on the bulk part of the surface, but they do not interact with the gluing of trumpets. Hence (4.4) tells us that before integrating over P we get a factor of 2P, so that the total gluing measure is 2P dP. Thus (2.18) follows.

### 4.5 Further properties of the quantum volumes

Contrary to the worldsheet definition, the intersection theory approach gives manifestly analytic expressions for the quantum volumes V (b) g,n. The integral over Mg,n picks out the top form in the power series expansion of the integrand. Thus, it follows directly from (4.14) that the quantum volumes are polynomial in c and P 2 1 , . . . , P2 n with rational coefficients

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\in\mathbb{Q}[c,P_{1}^{2},\ldots,P_{n}^{2}].\tag{4.18}$$

The degree is 3g − 3 + n, which generalizes the well-known polynomial behaviour of the Weil-Petersson volumes [96].

This also makes it clear that eq. (4.14) exhibits the following unexpected duality symmetry:

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(iP_{1},\ldots,iP_{n})=(-1)^{3g-3+n}\,{\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n}).\tag{4.19}$$

Indeed, sending c → 26 − c and Pj → iPj acts on (4.14) by a minus sign on the coefficients of κ1 and ψj in the exponent. The other classes are in H4• (Mg,n) and thus we simply act by a minus sign on H4•+2(Mg,n). The integral picks out the top form on moduli space, which leads to the identification (4.19). In the presence of a boundary, it follows from (2.18) that the symmetry is modified to

$$Z^{(ib)}_{g,n}(\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{n})=i^{2g-2+n}Z^{(b)}_{g,n}(-\beta_{1},\ldots,-\beta_{n}).\tag{4.20}$$

Note however that because of the appearance of the square root in the trumpet partition function (2.16b), the symmetry extends to a Z4 symmetry.

From the worldsheet point of view, such a duality symmetry cannot even be defined, since the central charge of the timelike Liouville theory is constrained to ˆc ≤ 1 and thus only makes sense after analytically continuing the result for the quantum volumes in c and Pj . However, the presence of this symmetry means that timelike and spacelike Liouville theory are at least morally on democratic footing.

## 5 Virasoro matrix integral

In this section we study the dual matrix integral for the Virasoro minimal string. We start by collecting some important equations and results in the bigger scheme of random matrix theory, particularly Hermitian matrix integrals.

### 5.1 A brief review of matrix integrals

A Hermitian matrix integral is an integral of the form

$${\cal M}_{N}=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{N2}}[{\rm d}H]\,{\rm e}^{-N\,{\rm tr}\,V(H)}\,\tag{5.1}$$

where H is a Hermitian N × N matrix and V (H) is a polynomial in H. Matrix integrals of the form (5.1) are solvable in the large N limit [97–102] (for reviews see [35, 103, 104]) and FN ≡ − log(MN ) admits a perturbative expansion in powers of 1/N. Using a saddle point approximation we can obtain the leading contribution (of order N2 ) and using e.g. orthogonal polynomials, loop equations and topological recursion we get higher-order contributions [105– 107]. Of particular interest is the so called double scaling limit. In this limit the full genus expansion can be reduced to solving a differential equation [32–34, 108].

Every Hermitian matrix can be diagonalized using a unitary matrix U such that H = UDHU † with DH ≡ diag(λ1, . . . , λN ) a real diagonal matrix. The trace is invariant under this diagonalisation, but the measure in (5.1) picks up a non-trivial Jacobian: this Jacobian is known as the Vandermonde determinant ∆N (λ) ≡ Q i̸=j |λi − λj |. Explicitly we have

$${\cal M}_{N}=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}\prod_{i=1}^{N}{\rm d}\lambda_{i}\,{\rm e}^{-N^{2}S[\lambda]}\,\quad S[\lambda]=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}V(\lambda_{i})-\frac{1}{N^{2}}\sum_{i\neq j}\log|\lambda_{i}-\lambda_{j}|.\tag{5.2}$$

Note the reduction from N2 to N degrees of freedom. The saddle point equations for (5.2) are

$$V^{\prime}(\lambda_{i})=\frac{2}{N}\sum_{j\neq i}\frac{1}{\lambda_{i}-\lambda_{j}}.\tag{5.3}$$

To solve this equation we introduce the normalized eigenvalue density

$$\varrho(\lambda)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\delta(\lambda-\lambda_{i})\,\qquad\quad\int_{a_{-}}^{a_{+}}{\rm d}\lambda\,\varrho(\lambda)=1\,\tag{5.4}$$

where we assume that all eigenvalues are located within the strip [a−, a+] on the real axis. Additionally we introduce the resolvent

$$R_{N}(E)\equiv\frac{1}{N}\,{\rm Tr}\,(E\,{\mathds{1}}_{N}-H)^{-1}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{1}{E-\lambda_{i}}\,\qquad E\in{\mathbb{C}}\setminus\{\lambda_{i}\}.\tag{5.5}$$

Sending N → ∞ the sum can be replaced by an integral where each eigenvalue is weighted by its average density

$$\lim_{N\to\infty}R_{N}(E)\equiv R(E)=\int_{a_{-}}^{a_{+}}{\rm d}\mu\,\frac{\varrho(\mu)}{E-\mu}\,\tag{5.6}$$

where we assume that the eigenvalue distribution is connected and has compact support on a single real interval [a−, a+]. The resolvent relates to the eigenvalue density and the matrix potential through the following relations

$$\varrho(E)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\left(R(E-i\varepsilon)-R(E+i\varepsilon)\right),\quad E\in\mbox{supp}(\varrho)\,\tag{5.7a}$$

$V^{\prime}(E)=R(E+i\varepsilon)+R(E-i\varepsilon)\,\quad E\in{\rm supp}(\varrho)\,$ (5.7b)

where ε is a small positive number and we used the large N limit of (5.3) to obtain (5.7b). Additionally it satisfies limE→∞ ER(E) = 1 which immediately follows from the definition (5.6).

In the next subsection we discuss methods to obtain correlation functions of the resolvents. These satisfy an expansion of the form

$$\langle R(E_{1})\ldots R(E_{n})\rangle_{\rm com.}\approx\sum_{g=0}^{\infty}\frac{R_{g,n}(E_{1},E_{2},\ldots,E_{n})}{N^{2g-2+n}}.\tag{5.8}$$

On the right hand side the power of N accounts for the genus and the number of boundaries. The resolvent (5.6) is equal to R0,1(E1) in this expansion. Without providing details since they can be found in multiple recent papers (see e.g. in [36, 109]) we also have

$$R_{0,2}(E_{1},E_{2})=\frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{\sqrt{-E_{1}}\sqrt{-E_{2}}(\sqrt{-E_{1}}+\sqrt{-E_{2}})^{2}}.\tag{5.9}$$

This result is universal for matrix integrals with support on a single interval.

### 5.2 Density of states and resolvent

In the double scaling limit we take the limit N → ∞ and zoom into one edge of the eigenvalue distribution. In this limit the perturbative eigenvalue distribution is supported on the entire real positive axis and becomes non-normalizable. The double-scaled matrix integral is perturbatively completely fixed by this density of eigenvalues. Upon double scaling the eigenvalue density is given by [36]

$$\varrho_{0}^{\rm total}(E)={\rm e}^{S_{0}}\,\varrho_{0}^{(b)}(E)\,\tag{5.10}$$

and hence eS0 is a rough analogue of N and plays the role of the parameter that controls the perturbative genus expansion. For example, (5.8) still holds after double scaling but with N replaced by eS0 . In the Virasoro matrix integral,

$$\varrho_{0}^{(b)}(E)\,{\rm d}E=\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)\,{\rm d}P=4\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi bP)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}P)\,{\rm d}P\,\tag{5.11}$$

where E = P 2 = hP − c−1 24 is the energy in the matrix model. For b → 0, one of the sinh's linearizes and we recover the famous sinh(√ E) dE density of states of JT gravity [36]. As already stressed in section 2.3, this is the universal Cardy density of states that endows the Virasoro matrix integral with its name.

One way to obtain ϱ (b) 0 (E) is through the inverse Laplace transform of the disk partition function (2.17a)

$$\varrho_{0}^{(b)}(E)=2\sqrt{2}\,\frac{\sinh(2\pi b\sqrt{E})\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}\sqrt{E})}{\sqrt{E}}=\int_{-i\infty+\gamma}^{i\infty+\gamma}\frac{\mathrm{d}\beta}{2\pi i}\,\mathrm{e}^{\beta E}Z_{\mathrm{disk}}^{(b)}(\beta)\,\tag{5.12}$$

where γ ∈ R+ is such that the contour is to the right of the singularities of Z (b) disk in the complex β plane.

Recall that the leading density of states ϱ (b) 0 may also be computed as the discontinuity of the genus-zero contribution to the resolvent, see equation (5.7a). For (g, n) ̸= (0, 1), all other resolvents may be obtained from the partition functions Z (b) g,n (which are in turn related to the quantum volumes by gluing trumpets as in (2.18)) by Laplace transform as

$$R^{(b)}_{g,n}(-z^{2}_{1},\ldots,-z^{2}_{n})=\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\prod_{j=1}^{n}{\rm d}\beta_{j}\,{\rm e}^{-\beta_{j}z^{2}_{j}}\right)Z^{(b)}_{g,n}(\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{n}).\tag{5.13}$$

Here we have written the energies Ei = −z 2 i as negative for convergence of the integrals, but may analytically continue to positive energies afterwards. Hence by combining eq. (2.18) and (5.13) the quantum volumes themselves may be obtained from the resolvents by inverse Laplace transform

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})=\int_{-i\infty+\gamma}^{i\infty+\gamma}\Big{(}\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{{\rm d}z_{j}}{2\pi{\rm i}}\,{\rm e}^{{\rm i}\pi P_{j}z_{j}}\,\frac{\sqrt{2}z_{j}}{P_{j}}\Big{)}R^{(b)}_{g,n}(-z_{1}^{2},\ldots,-z_{n}^{2})\,\tag{5.14}$$

for γ sufficiently large.

### 5.3 Topological recursion

We now define the spectral curve [36, 107] of the Virasoro matrix integral

$$y^{(b)}(z)=-2\sqrt{2}\pi\frac{\sin(2\pi bz)\sin(2\pi b^{-1}z)}{z}\,\tag{5.15}$$

where z 2 ≡ −E as before. We also define ω (b) 0,1 (z) ≡ 2zy(b) (z)dz. Adjusting our notation to [36] we introduce the following modified resolvents

$$\omega^{(b)}_{g,n}(z_{1},\ldots,z_{n})\equiv(-1)^{n}2^{n}z_{1}\ldots z_{n}R^{(b)}_{g,n}(-z_{1}^{2},\ldots,-z_{n}^{2}){\rm d}z_{1}\ldots{\rm d}z_{n}.\tag{5.16}$$

In particular using (5.16) it follows from (5.9)

$$\omega_{0,2}^{(b)}(z_{1},z_{2})=\frac{{\rm d}z_{1}{\rm d}z_{2}}{(z_{1}-z_{2})^{2}}\,\tag{5.17}$$

where a convenient branch choice was made. For 2g−2+n > 0 we obtain the ω (b) g,n(z1, . . . , zn) from the recursion

$$\omega^{(b)}_{g,n}(z_{1},z_{2},\ldots,z_{n})=\text{Res}_{z\to0}\Big{(}K^{(b)}(z_{1},z)\big{[}\omega^{(b)}_{g-1,n+1}(z,-z,z_{2},\ldots z_{n})\tag{5.18}$$ $$+\sum_{h=0}^{g}\sum_{\begin{subarray}{c}\underline{\Omega}:\underline{\mathcal{J}}=[z_{2},-z_{n}]\\ \{h,\underline{\mathcal{J}}\neq\{0,0\}\\ \{h,\mathcal{J}\}\neq\{g,0\}\end{subarray}}\omega^{(b)}_{h,1+|\underline{\mathcal{I}}|}(z,\mathcal{I})\omega^{(b)}_{g-h,1+|\mathcal{J}|}(-z,\mathcal{J})\big{]}\Big{)}\,$$

where the recursion kernel K(b) (z1, z) is given by

$$K^{(b)}(z_{1},z)\equiv\frac{\int_{-z}^{z}\omega_{0,2}^{(b)}(z_{1},-)}{4\omega_{0,1}^{(b)}(z)}=-\frac{1}{(z_{1}^{2}-z^{2})}\frac{z}{8\sqrt{2}\pi\sin(2\pi bz)\sin(2\pi b^{-1}z)}.\tag{5.19}$$

These are the loop equations of the double-scaled matrix integral in the language of topological recursion. It determines the resolvent correlators (5.8) completely from the initial data R0,1(E) ≡ R(E) (5.6). Let us list some of the ω (b) g,n:

$$\omega^{(b)}_{0,1}(z_{1})=-4\sqrt{2}\pi\sin(2\pi bz_{1})\sin(2\pi b^{-1}z_{1}){\rm d}z_{1}\,\tag{5.20a}$$

$$\omega^{(b)}_{0,2}(z_{1},z_{2})=\frac{{\rm d}z_{1}{\rm d}z_{2}}{(z_{1}-z_{2})^{2}}\,\tag{5.20b}$$

$$\omega^{(b)}_{0,3}(z_{1},z_{2},z_{3})=-\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{3}\times2\sqrt{2}}\frac{{\rm d}z_{1}{\rm d}z_{2}{\rm d}z_{3}}{z_{1}^{2}z_{2}^{2}z_{3}^{2}}\,\tag{5.20c}$$

$$\omega^{(b)}_{0,4}(z_{1},z_{2},z_{3},z_{4})=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{4}}\left(\frac{c-13}{96}+\frac{3}{8(2\pi)^{2}}\sum_{i=1}^{4}\frac{1}{z_{i}^{2}}\right)\frac{{\rm d}z_{1}{\rm d}z_{2}{\rm d}z_{3}{\rm d}z_{4}}{z_{1}^{2}z_{2}^{2}z_{3}^{2}z_{4}^{2}}\,\tag{5.20d}$$

ω (b) 1,1 (z1) = − 1 24π √ 2 c − 13 48 + 3 (4π) 2 1 z 2 1 dz1 z 2 1 , (5.20e)

$$\omega_{1,2}^{(b)}(z_{1},z_{2})=\frac{1}{(4\pi)^{6}}\bigg{[}\frac{3}{z_{1}^{2}z_{2}^{2}}+5\left(\frac{1}{z_{4}^{2}}+\frac{1}{z_{4}^{2}}\right)+\frac{2\pi^{2}}{3}(c-13)\left(\frac{1}{z_{1}^{2}}+\frac{1}{z_{2}^{2}}\right)\tag{5.20f}$$ $$+\frac{\pi^{4}}{18}(c-17)(c-9)\bigg{]}\frac{\mathrm{d}z_{1}\mathrm{d}z_{2}}{z_{1}^{2}z_{2}^{2}}\.$$

Let us explain how the topological recursion can be obtained from the definition of the quantum volumes in terms of integrals over the moduli space of curves Mg,n. This is a straightforward application of the result of [59]. [59, Theorem 3.3] states that for any choice of initial data ω (b) 0,1 , ω (b) g,n as computed from the topological recursion (5.18) is equal to the following intersection number of Mg,n:

$$\omega^{(b)}_{g,n}(z_{1},\ldots,z_{n})=2^{3g-3+n}\int_{\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}}\mathrm{e}^{\sum_{m}\tilde{t}_{m}\kappa_{m}}\prod_{j=1}^{n}\sum_{\ell\geq0}\frac{\Gamma(\ell+\frac{3}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{3}{2})}\frac{\psi^{\ell}_{j}\,\mathrm{d}z_{j}}{z_{j}^{2\ell+2}}.\tag{5.21}$$

The numbers t˜m are defined in terms of ω (b) 0,1 as follows. We expand ω (b) 0,1 (z) in (5.20a) for small z leading to

$$\omega^{(b)}_{0,1}(z)=\sum_{m\geq0}\frac{\Gamma(\frac{3}{2})t_{m}}{\Gamma(m+\frac{3}{2})}\,z^{2m+2}\,{\rm d}z.\tag{5.22}$$

The coefficients t˜m in (5.21) are then defined via the equality of the following power series in u

$$\sum_{m\geq0}t_{m}u^{m}=\exp\Big{(}-\sum_{m\geq0}\tilde{t}_{m}u^{m}\Big{)}.\tag{5.23}$$

In our case, it follows from (5.20) that

$$\tilde{t}_{0}=-\frac{3}{2}\log(8\pi^{2})+\pi i\,\tag{5.24a}$$

$$\hat{t}_{1}=\frac{c-13}{24}\,(2\pi)^{2}\,\tag{5.24b}$$

$$\tilde{t}_{2m}=-\frac{B_{2m}(2\pi)^{4m}}{(2m)(2m)!}\,\quad m\geq1.\tag{5.24c}$$

Using that κ0 = 2g − 2 + n, we thus obtain

ω (b) g,n(z1, . . . , zn)

= (2π) 6−6g−3n 2 − n 2 (−1)n Z Mg,n exp c − 13 24 (2π) 2κ1 − X m≥1 B2m(2π) 4m (2m)(2m)! κ2m X ℓ≥0 Γ(ℓ + 3 2 ) Γ( 3 2 ) ψ ℓ j dzj z 2ℓ+2 j = 2− 3n 2 (−π) −n Z Mg,n exp c − 13 24 κ1 − X m≥1 B2m κ2m (2m)(2m)!X ℓ≥0 Γ(ℓ + 3 2 ) Γ( 3 2 )(2π) 2ℓ ψ ℓ j dzj z 2ℓ+2 j = Z Y j (−4 √ 2πPjdPj e −4πzjPj ) Z Mg,n exp c − 13 24 κ1 − X m≥1 B2m κ2m (2m)(2m)!X ℓ≥0 P 2ℓ j ψ ℓ j dzj ℓ! = Z ∞ 0 Y j (−4 √ 2πPjdPj e −4πzjPj ) V (b) g,n(P1, . . . , Pn) dz1 . . . dzn , (5.25)

where we used the definition of the quantum volumes in terms of intersection numbers given in eq. (4.14). This formula is valid for Re zj > 0, but can be extended to any complex value of zj by analytic continuation.

For concreteness we can confirm the above relation (5.25) for the quantum volume V (b) 0,4 (2.19a) of the four punctured sphere and the quantum volume V (b) 1,1 (2.19b) of the once punctured disk. Using also the expressions for (5.20d) and (5.20e) we easily confirm

$$\omega_{0,4}^{(b)}(z_{1},z_{2},z_{3},z_{4})=\left[(-4\sqrt{2}\pi)^{4}\int_{0}^{\infty}\prod_{j=1}^{4}(P_{j}\mathrm{d}P_{j}\,\mathrm{e}^{-4\pi z_{j}P_{j}})\Big{(}\frac{c-13}{24}+\sum_{j=1}^{4}P_{j}^{2}\Big{)}\right]\mathrm{d}z_{1}\mathrm{d}z_{2}\mathrm{d}z_{3}\mathrm{d}z_{4}\tag{5.26a}$$ $$\omega_{1,1}^{(b)}(z_{1})=\left[(-4\sqrt{2}\pi)\int_{0}^{\infty}(P_{1}\mathrm{d}P_{1}\,\mathrm{e}^{-4\pi z_{1}P_{1}})\Big{(}\frac{c-13}{576}+\frac{1}{24}P_{1}^{2}\Big{)}\right]\mathrm{d}z_{1}\;.\tag{5.26b}$$

This provides the crucial link between intersection theory and the Virasoro matrix integral and hence the last missing arrow in figure 1. The same perturbative data can now be expressed in terms of the resolvents/differentials ω (b) g,n, the partition functions Z (b) g,n or the quantum volumes V (b) g,n. They carry all the same information and are related by simple integral transforms, which we summarize in figure 6. We have already seen most of the required relations in this triangle diagram. For completeness, let us also state the last two relations,

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})=\int_{\Gamma}\left(\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{{\rm d}\beta_{j}}{2\pi i}\,\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\beta_{j}}}\,\sigma_{j}^{\beta_{j}P_{j}^{2}}\right)Z^{(b)}_{g,n}(\frac{4\pi^{2}}{\beta_{1}},\ldots,\frac{4\pi^{2}}{\beta_{n}})\,\tag{5.27a}$$

$$Z^{(b)}_{g,n}(\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{n})=\int_{\Gamma}\left(\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{{\rm d}u_{j}}{2\pi i}\,e^{\beta_{j}u_{j}}\right)R^{(b)}_{g,n}(-u_{1},\ldots,-u_{n})\,\tag{5.27b}$$

where in both cases the integration contours Γ are vertical and to the right of all singularities of the relevant integrands.

![](_page_45_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 6: There are three quantities that all capture the same information that we discussed. They are all related by simple integral transformations, which we summarize here. We also recall that the differentials ω (b) g,n are just a more convenient way to write the resolvent; they are simply related via (5.16).

### 5.4 Deformed Mirzakhani recursion relation

We can translate the topological recursion (5.18) into a recursion relation for the quantum volumes V (b) g,n. For the original case of Mirzakhani's recursion, this was done for the Weil-Petersson volumes in [110], while various generalizations with supersymmetry were considered in [109]. Let us first note that since the differentials ω (b) g,n are polynomial in inverse powers of z −2 j , we can rewrite (5.14) as

$$\mathsf{V}^{(b)}_{\vartheta,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})=\int_{\Gamma}\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{i\,\mathrm{e}^{i\pi z_{j}P_{j}}}{2\sqrt{2\pi}P_{j}}\,\omega^{(b)}_{\vartheta,n}(z_{1},\ldots,z_{n})=\prod_{j=1}^{n}\operatorname*{Res}_{z_{j}=0}\frac{-\mathrm{e}^{i\pi z_{j}P_{j}}}{\sqrt{2}P_{j}}\omega^{(b)}_{\vartheta,n}(z_{1},\ldots,z_{n})\,\tag{5.28}$$

where again Γ is a contour that runs on the positively oriented shifted imaginary axis to the right of all singularities of the integrand. This representation is valid for Re Pj > 0, otherwise the result follows from analytic continuation. In the second representation, we used that zj = 0 is the only singularity of ω (b) g,n, provided that 3g − 3 + n ≥ 0.

Let us derive the first term in (2.13) from the topological recursion, all other terms are obtained by very similar computations. We can set n = 1, since all Pj 's in P are spectators. We have

P1V (b) g,1 (P1) = − 1 √ 2 Res z1=0 e 4πz1P1 ω (b) g,1 (z1) ⊃ − 1 √ 2 Res z1=0 e 4πz1P1 Res z=0 K(b) (z1, z) ω (b) g−1,2 (z, −z) = − 1 √ 2 Res z1=0 e 4πz1P1 Res z=0 K(b) (z1, z) ω (b) g−1,2 (z, z) = −4π 2 √ 2 Res z1=0 Res z=0 e 4πz1P1 K(b) (z1, z) × Z (2P dP)(2P ′ dP ′ ) e−4πz(P +P ′ )V (b) g−1,2 (P, P′ ) . (5.29)

We used that all the multi-differentials (except for ω (b) 0,2 ) are symmetric in zj . We can commute the two residues as follows:

Res Res = Res Res + Res Res $z_{1}$=0 $z$=0 $z$=0 $z_{1}$=$z$ =0 $z_{1}$=$-z$ (5.30)

since as a function of z1, the appearing function only has poles at z1 = z and z1 = −z. Using the explicit form of the recursion kernel (5.19) we can take the z1-residue, which leads to

$$P_{1}\mathsf{V}_{g,1}^{(b)}(P_{1})\supset\operatorname*{Res}_{z=0}\frac{\pi\sinh(4\pi P_{1}z)}{2\sin(2\pi bz)\sin(2\pi b^{-1}z)}\int(2P\,\mathrm{d}P)(2P^{\prime}\,\mathrm{d}P^{\prime})\,\mathrm{e}^{-4\pi z(P+P^{\prime})}\mathsf{V}_{g-1,2}^{(b)}(P,P^{\prime})$$ $$=\operatorname*{Res}_{t=0}\frac{\pi\sin(4\pi P_{1}t)}{2\sinh(2\pi bt)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}t)}\int(2P\,\mathrm{d}P)(2P^{\prime}\,\mathrm{d}P^{\prime})\,\mathrm{e}^{4\pi\mathrm{i}t(P+P^{\prime})}\mathsf{V}_{g-1,2}^{(b)}(P,P^{\prime})\,\tag{5.31}$$

where we set z = −it in the last equality. We can now rewrite the residue integral as a difference of two integrals as follows:

P1V (b) g,1 (P1) ⊃ Z R−iε − Z R+iε dt sin(4πP1t) 4isinh(2πbt) sinh(2πb−1 t) × Z (2P dP)(2P ′ dP ′ ) e4πit(P +P ′ )V (b) g−1,2 (P, P′ ) = Z R−iε dt sin(4πP1t) 4isinh(2πbt) sinh(2πb−1 t) Z (2P dP)(2P ′ dP ′ ) e−4πit(P +P ′ )V (b) g−1,2 (P, P′ ) − Z R+iε dt sin(4πP1t) 4isinh(2πbt) sinh(2πb−1 t) Z (2P dP)(2P ′ dP ′ ) e4πit(P +P ′ )V (b) g−1,2 (P, P′ ) . (5.32)

We used that the integral over P and P ′ is only absolutely convergent for Im t > 0 and is otherwise defined by analytic continuation. However, it is an even function in t and can thus be obtained by replacing t → −t for the contour R − iε. At this point all integrals are absolutely convergent and thus we can exchange the t-integral with the P and P ′ integral. This gives the desired form of Mirzakhani's recursion relation (2.13), with kernel

$$H(x,y)=\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^{-it}}\mathrm{d}t\,\frac{\sin(4\pi yt)\,\mathrm{e}^{-4\pi isit}}{4i\sinh(2\pi bt)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}t)}-\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^{+it}}\mathrm{d}t\,\frac{\sin(4\pi yt)\,\mathrm{e}^{4\pi isit}}{4i\sinh(2\pi bt)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}t)}.\tag{5.33}$$

This can be further massaged as follows to bring it to the form (2.14). Indeed, we can rewrite both integrals in terms of principal value integrals by picking up some part of the residue at t = 0. This gives

$$H(x,y)=\frac{y}{2}-\mbox{PV}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\!\!\mbox{d}t\,\frac{\sin(4\pi yt)(\mbox{e}^{4\pi ixt}-\mbox{e}^{-4\pi ixt})}{4i\sinh(2\pi bt)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}t)}\tag{5.34}$$ $$=\frac{y}{2}-\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\mbox{d}t\,\frac{\sin(4\pi xt)\sin(4\pi yt)}{\sinh(2\pi bt)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}t)}\,$$

which is the form given in eq. (2.14).

Let us also mention that for an efficient implementation of Mirzkhani's recursion relation, we have the following integral formulas:

$$\int_{0}^{\infty}(2x\,{\rm d}x)\ x^{2k}H(x,t)=F_{k}(t)\,\tag{5.35a}$$ $$=\int_{0}^{\infty}(2x\,{\rm d}x)\ x^{2k}H(x,t)=F_{k}(t)\,\tag{5.35b}$$

$$\int_{0}^{\infty}(2x\,{\rm d}x)\,(2y\,{\rm d}y)\,x^{2k}y^{2\ell}H(x+y,t)=\frac{2(2k+1)!(2\ell+1)!}{(2k+2\ell+3)!}\,F_{k+\ell+1}(t)\,\tag{5.35b}$$

where

$$F_{k}(t)=\mathop{\rm Res}_{u=0}\frac{(2k+1)!(-1)^{k+1}\sin(2tu)}{2^{2k+3}u^{2k+2}\sinh(bu)\sinh(b^{-1}u)}\tag{5.36}$$

$$=\sum_{0\leq\ell+m\leq k+1}\frac{(-1)^{\ell+m}(2k+1)!B_{2\ell}B_{2m}(1-2^{1-2\ell})(1-2^{1-2m})b^{2\ell-2m}t^{2k+3-2\ell-2m}}{(2\ell)!(2m)!(2k+3-2\ell-2m)!}.\tag{5.37}$$

We provide such an implementation in the ancillary Mathematica file.

# Part III Evidence and applications

## 6 Non-perturbative effects

In this section we discuss some of the non-perturbative effects of the Virasoro matrix integral. Our discussion follows the logic in [36] and we avoid adding too many details as they can be found therein. In particular [36, eq. 155] expresses the leading perturbative and leading non-perturbative behaviour of the density of eigenvalues. For the eigenvalue density (5.11) of the Virasoro minimal string we find

$$\langle\varrho^{(b)}(E)\rangle\approx\begin{cases}\mathrm{e}^{S_{0}}\varrho_{0}^{(b)}(E)-\frac{1}{4\pi E}\cos\left(2\pi\mathrm{e}^{S_{0}}\int_{0}^{E}\mathrm{d}E^{\prime}\varrho_{0}^{(b)}(E^{\prime})\right)\,&E>0\\ \frac{1}{-8\pi E}\exp\left(-V_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(b)}(E)\right)\,&E<0\,\end{cases}\tag{6.1}$$

where the effective potential V (b) eff is defined as

$$V^{(b)}_{\rm eff}(E)=2{\rm e}^{S_{0}}\int_{0}^{-E}{\rm d}x\,y^{(b)}(\sqrt{x})=2\sqrt{2}\,{\rm e}^{S_{0}}\left(\frac{\sin(2\pi\widehat{Q}\sqrt{-E}\,)}{\widehat{Q}}-\frac{\sin(2\pi Q\sqrt{-E}\,)}{Q}\right)\;,\tag{6.2}$$

with Q = b −1 + b and Qb = b −1 − b defined in section 2.2. The effective potential is the combination of the potential V (λ) (5.1) and the Vandermonde Jacobian (5.2). In figure 7 we see the oscillatory behaviour of the effective potential for some values of b. As in the JT case the term in the allowed region E is rapidly oscillating and larger than the first subleading perturbative contribution. On the other side we find a non-zero contribution in the classically forbidden regime E < 0. It accounts for the possibility of one eigenvalue sitting in the regime E < 0.

### 6.1 Non-perturbative corrections to the quantum volumes

The leading non-perturbative correction to the quantum volume V (b) n (S0; P1, . . . , Pn) is controlled by configurations of the matrix integral where one eigenvalue is in the classically forbidden region E < 0 and all the others are in the allowed region. Thus the leading non-perturbative correction is naturally given as an integral of the form

$$\int_{-\infty}^{0}{\rm d}E\ \langle\varrho^{(b)}(E)\rangle\ \ldots\tag{6.3}$$

![](_page_49_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 7: Plot of the effective potential V (b) eff (E) of the double-scaled Virasoro matrix integral in the region E < 0, shown for several values of the parameter b ̸= 1. Extrema of the effective potential occur at E∗ k,± = − k 2 b±2 4 .

for some operator insertions · · · depending on the quantity under consideration. In particular, for the quantum volumes, the operator insertions can be determined intuitively as follows. For a more rigorous derivation, we refer to [36, appendix A].

Let us start by discussing the leading non-perturbative correction to the resummed partition function

$$Z^{(b)}_{n}(S_{0};\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{n})\equiv\sum_{g=0}^{\infty}Z^{(b)}_{g,n}(\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{n})\,{\rm e}^{-(2g-2+n)S_{0}}.\tag{6.4}$$

Z (b) g,n(β1, . . . , βn) is obtained by inserting Qn j=1 tr (e−βjH) into the matrix integral. Focussing now on the single eigenvalue in the forbidden region, the insertions in (6.3) should be Qn j=1 e −βjE. We can then compute the corresponding insertions for the quantum volumes V (b) n by removing the trumpets, i.e. inverting (2.18). This basically amounts to an inverse Laplace transformation, see eq. (5.27a). However, in the process, we have to commute the integral over E with the integral of the inverse Laplace transform, which is not quite allowed. This makes the present derivation non-rigorous. Let us anyway go ahead. The inverse Laplace transform predicts the following operator insertion for the quantum volumes, assuming that the energy E < 0:

$$\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\gamma-i\infty}^{\gamma+i\infty}{\rm d}x\ {\rm e}^{P^{2}x}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{x}}\ {\rm e}^{-\frac{4\pi^{2}E}{x}}\tag{6.5}$$

for γ a positive constant. By deforming the contour appropriately, this is easily evaluated to

$$\sqrt{2}\,{\rm e}^{-4\pi|P|\sqrt{-E}}\tag{6.6}$$

However this is not quite the right result because of the illegal exchange of contours. As usual, the correct result is analytic in P and symmetric under exchange P → −P. Following the analogous more careful derivation of Saad, Shenker and Stanford [36, appendix A], shows that the operator insertion is actually the average of both sign choices in the exponent. This is the unique choice that is both reflection symmetric and analytic in P. Summarizing, we hence have for the first non-perturbative correction (that we denote by a superscript [1])

$${\sf V}_{n}^{(b)}(S_{0};P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})^{[1]}=\int_{-\infty}^{0}{\rm d}E\ \langle\varrho^{(b)}(E)\rangle\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{\sqrt{2}\sinh(4\pi P_{j}\sqrt{-E})}{P_{j}}\,\tag{6.7}$$

where ⟨ϱ (b) (E)⟩ is given by (6.1).

Non-perturbative (in)stability. Before continuing, we have to discuss an important issue. So far, the discussion makes it sound as if the non-perturbative corrections are unique. But this is actually not the case, because the integral in (6.7) is divergent unless b = 1. The reason for this is that unless b = 1, the sign of V (b) eff is indefinite and as a consequence, ⟨ϱ (b) (E)⟩ can be arbitrarily large for negative energies. This means that the model is nonperturbatively unstable and all eigenvalues will tunnel to minima of V (b) eff (E) at smaller and smaller energies. For b = 1 instead, V (b) eff (E) is monotonic and ⟨ϱ (b) (E)⟩ decays exponentially as E → −∞. Thus the model is non-perturbatively stable. These two different behaviours are depicted in figure 8.

The non-perturbative instability does not mean that the model is non-sensical. Instead, the simplest way out is to deform the integration contour over the eigenvalues of the matrix. This however means that the non-perturbative completion of the model is not unique. As we shall discuss in section 8.2, the same ambiguities also arise when we reproduce these nonperturbative corrections from the worldsheet. For example, we can deform the integration contour to run to an extremum of ⟨ϱ (b) (E)⟩ and then turn into the complex plane, as we do below.

Alternatively, one can also follow the route proposed in [111] to construct a different non-perturbative completion of the matrix integral, but it is not clear how to reproduce this structure from the worldsheet.

Single instanton contribution. Let us assume that b ̸= 1 for now. We discuss the special case b = 1 further below in subsection 6.3. Each possible instanton correction on the

Figure 8: Plot of the effective potential V (b) eff (E) of the double-scaled Virasoro matrix integral in the region E < 0, for b close to one. For b ̸= 1 the effective potential is oscillatory, while for b exactly equal to one it is monotonically increasing.

worldsheet will be associated to one of the extrema of V (b) eff (E). They come in two infinite families and are located at

$$E^{*}_{k,\pm}=-\frac{k^{2}b^{\pm2}}{4},\quad k\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq1}.\tag{6.8}$$

For the one-instanton correction, we simply have to expand the integrand (6.7) around one of these saddle points. The corresponding non-perturbative correction is thus given by

V (b) n (S0; P1, . . . , Pn) [1] k,± = Z γk,± dE −1 8πE∗ k,± e −V (b) eff (E∗ k,±)− 1 2 (E−E∗ k,±) 2 (V (b) eff ) ′′(E∗ k,±) × Yn j=1 √ 2 sinh(4πPj p−E∗ k,± ) Pj = − i e −V (b) eff (E∗ k,±) 8πE∗ k,± s −π 2(V (b) eff ) ′′(E∗ k,± ) Yn j=1 √ 2 sinh(4πPj p−E∗ k,± ) Pj . (6.9)

The contour γk,± takes the form sketched in figure 9. We should also mention that we only kept the imaginary part of the expression (which does not get contributions from the real line), since it is the only unambiguous part of the contour integral. The result is only one half of the Gaussian integral, since the contour turns into the complex plane. This is explained in more detail in [60]. To bring this expression into a form that is interpretable in string theory, let us denote

$$T^{(b)}_{k,\pm}=V^{(b)}_{\rm eff}(E^{*}_{k,\pm})=\frac{4\sqrt{2}\,{\rm e}^{S_{0}}b^{\pm1}(-1)^{k+1}\sin(\pi kb^{\pm2})}{1-b^{\pm4}}.\tag{6.10}$$

![](_page_52_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 9: The integration contour γk,± for the computation of instanton corrections in the sector (k, ±). We could have also chosen the contour reflected at the real axis, which would lead to the opposite sign in the result (6.12). This reflects the ambiguity of the non-perturbative completion discussed above on the matrix integral side.

T (b) k,± has the physical interpretation of the tension of the corresponding ZZ-instanton in the bulk description. Notice that it may be positive or negative, reflecting that most of these instanton corrections should not live on the integration contour of the matrix integral. We will nonetheless be able to match them to the corresponding bulk quantities below. We also note that

$$(V^{(b)}_{\rm eff})^{\prime\prime}(E^{*}_{k,\pm})=T^{(b)}_{k,\pm}\frac{(V^{(b)}_{\rm eff})^{\prime\prime}(E^{*}_{k,\pm})}{V^{(b)}_{\rm eff}(E^{*}_{k,\pm})}=T^{(b)}_{k,\pm}\frac{4\pi^{2}(1-b^{\mp4})}{k^{2}}.\tag{6.11}$$

Thus we can rewrite (6.9) as

$${\sf V}_{n}^{(b)}(S_{0};P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})_{k,\pm}^{[1]}=\frac{i\,{\rm e}^{-T_{k,\pm}^{(b)}}}{2^{\frac{1}{2}}\pi^{\frac{1}{2}}(T_{k,\pm}^{(b)})^{\frac{1}{2}}(1-b^{\pm4})^{\frac{1}{2}}k}\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi b^{\pm1}P_{j})}{P_{j}}.\tag{6.12}$$

#### 6.2 Large g asymptotics of V (b) g,n

From the leading non-perturbative correction V (b) n (S0; P1, . . . , Pn) [1] to V (b) n (S0; P1, . . . , Pn), one can also determine the asymptotic behaviour of the quantum volumes V (b) g,n(P1, . . . , Pn) at large genus g using resurgence techniques. Assuming 0 < b < 1, the closest saddle-point to the origin is the contribution from the saddle point (6.8) (1, +). The existence of nonperturbative corrections indicates that the series (2.8) is asymptotic. Let us look at its Borel transform,

$$\widetilde{\mathsf{V}}_{n}^{(b)}(x;P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})=\sum_{g=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{2g}}{(2g)!}\,\mathsf{V}_{g,n}^{(b)}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\,\tag{6.13}$$

which has a finite radius of convergence in x. V (b) n (S0; P1, . . . , Pn) can then be recovered via a Laplace transform

$${\sf V}_{n}^{(b)}(S_{0};P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})={\rm e}^{-(n-2)S_{0}}\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!{\rm d}x\ {\rm e}^{-x}\,\widetilde{\sf V}_{n}^{(b)}(x\,{\rm e}^{-S_{0}};P_{1},\ldots,P_{n}).\tag{6.14}$$

In the cases of interest to us, Ve(b) n will have singularities on the real axis and thus the integral over x actually has to be deformed into the complex plane to give a non-perturbative completion of the summation. This leads to the same non-perturbative ambiguities that were already observed above. In particular, the large g asymptotics of V (b) g,n controls the radius of convergence of the Borel transform in the x-plane.

As we shall see, the quantum volumes, V (b) g,n(P1, . . . , Pn) have the following universal behaviour as g → ∞,

$${\rm V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\sim(2g)!\cdot AB^{g}g^{C}\tag{6.15}$$

for functions A, B and C depending on b and n that we will now determine. The (2g)! growth ensures that the Borel transform will have singularities in the x-plane. This behaviour implies that Ve(b) n (x; P1, . . . , Pn) behaves as

$$\bar{\bf V}_{n}^{(b)}(x;P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\sim A\,\Gamma(C+1)\,(1-Bx^{2})^{-C-1}+\mbox{less singular}\tag{6.16}$$

near the two singularities x = ± √ 1 B in the Borel plane. In particular, when C ̸∈ Z, the Borel transform has a branch cut running along the real axis starting from x = √ 1 B . We can then plug this behaviour into (6.14). The branch cut will lead to an imaginary part in the answer, which we can then compare with the first non-perturbative correction (6.12) of the quantum volumes. We deform the contour above the branch cut and only focus on the imaginary part of the answer. Thus resurgence predicts the following asymptotics of the quantum volumes

$${\sf V}_{n}^{(b)}(S_{0};P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})^{[1]}=i\,{\rm e}^{-(n-2)S_{0}}\int_{B^{-\frac{1}{2}}{\rm e}_{0}}^{\infty}{\rm d}x\ {\rm e}^{-x}A\,\Gamma(C+1)\ {\rm Im}(1-Bx^{2}\,{\rm e}^{-2S_{0}})^{-C-1}\tag{6.17}$$ $$\sim\frac{A\pi i}{2^{C+1}B^{\frac{C+1}{2}}}\,{\rm e}^{-B^{-\frac{1}{2}}\,\phi_{0}}{\rm e}^{(3+C-n)S_{0}}\.$$

Comparing to (6.12), we hence see that

$$B={\rm e}^{-2S_{0}}\big{(}T^{(b)}_{1,+}\big{)}^{-2}\,\qquad C=n-\frac{7}{2}\,\tag{6.18}$$

which is required to match the correct S0 dependence. The fact that this matches the S0 dependence of the non-perturbative correction to V (b) n justifies our ansatz (6.15) a posteriori. We can then compare the prefactors to conclude

$$A=\frac{\left({\rm e}^{S_{0}}T_{1,+}^{(b)}\right)^{2-n}}{2^{5}\pi^{\frac{5}{2}}(1-b^{4})^{\frac{1}{2}}}\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{2\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi bP_{j})}{P_{j}}.\tag{6.19}$$

To summarize, we have extracted the following large g behaviour of the quantum volumes,

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\stackrel{{g\geq1}}{{\sim}}\frac{\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{\sqrt{2\sinh(2\pi b)}}{P_{j}}}{2^{\frac{2}{2}\pi^{\frac{n}{4}}(1-b^{4})^{\frac{1}{2}}}}\times\left(\frac{4\sqrt{2}b\sin(\pi b^{2})}{1-b^{4}}\right)^{2-2g-n}\times\Gamma\big{(}2g+n-\frac{5}{2}\big{)}\,\tag{6.20}$$

where we need to assume that 0 < b < 1. We also assume in this formula that P1, . . . , Pn and b are held constant while taking the large g limit. It is interesting to note that even though the quantum volumes are all polynomial in P 2 j and c = 1 + 6(b + b −1 ) 2 , the large g asymptotics is highly non-polynomial. We should also note that this formula implies that the string coupling gs = e−S0 is renormalized to its effective value

$$g_{\rm s}^{\rm eff}=\frac{1-b^{4}}{4\sqrt{2b}\sin(\pi b^{2})}\,{\rm e}^{-S_{0}}=(T_{1,+}^{(b)})^{-1}.\tag{6.21}$$

Some consistency checks. We can perform some simple consistency checks on this expression. We first remark that (6.20) is consistent with the dilaton equation (4.15a) in a somewhat non-trivial way. The LHS of the string equation (4.15b) vanishes for the asymptotic formula (6.20). This is consistent with the right hand side, since it is suppressed by one power of 1 g .

Finally, (6.20) formally reduces to known formulas for the Weil-Petersson volumes when taking the limit b → 0. Using (2.22) as well as (2.24), we obtain

$$V_{g,n}(\ell_{1},\ldots,\ell_{n})\sim\frac{(4\pi^{2})^{2g-2+n}}{2^{\frac{3}{2}}\pi^{\frac{5}{2}}}\,\Gamma\big{(}2g+n-\frac{5}{2}\big{)}\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{2\sinh(\frac{\ell_{j}}{2})}{\ell_{j}}\,\tag{6.22}$$

which matches with the formulas derived in [36, 112–119]. In particular, [119] develops the large g asymptotics much more systematically beyond the leading order.

Explicit check. We can compare (6.20) explicitly against the first few quantum volumes as computed from intersection theory or the recursion relation (2.13). Let us first focus on the case n = 0. For the Weil-Petersson volumes, this was done in [112] using more efficient algorithms for the computation of the volumes. In our case, we do not know of such an algorithm and the most efficient method for the computation of the volumes is the direct computation via intersection numbers on moduli space. We were able to evaluate the volumes up to g = 12 directly. The Mathematica notebook implementing this is attached to the publication as an ancillary file. The ratio of the quantum volumes and the asymptotic formula is displayed in figure 10. We also extrapolated the result to g = ∞ by using the general fact that the corrections to the asymptotic formula (6.20) are of the form

$$\begin{array}{l}\mbox{$\mathsf{V}_{g,n}^{(b)}$}\\ \mbox{$\mathsf{(6.20)}$}\end{array}=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}x_{j}g^{-j}\.\tag{6.23}$$

This mirrors the fact that the string perturbation theory expansion is a power series in gs (as opposed to g 2 s ) in the one-instanton sector). We fitted x0, . . . , x10 from the data and plotted the asymptotic value given by x0.

![](_page_55_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 10: The ratio of the exact volumes and the asymptotic formula (6.20) up to g = 12. The last curve is the extrapolation of the low g data to g = ∞.

From the figure, it is clear that the asymptotic formula is good for b well away from b = 1. This is expected since for b = 1, the saddle point approximation above breaks down because two saddles collide in that case.

We also checked the asymptotic formula for V (b) g,1 (P1). In figure 11, we plotted the ratio of the volume at genus 12 with the formula (6.20) as a function of P1. The approximation is good for b well away from b = 1 and P1 sufficiently small.

### 6.3 The special case b = 1

The case b = 1 needs to be treated separately. For b exactly equal to one the effective potential

$$V_{\rm eff}^{(b=1)}(E)=\sqrt{2}\,{\rm e}^{S_{0}}\left(4\pi\sqrt{-E}-\sin(4\pi\sqrt{-E})\right)\tag{6.24}$$

is no longer oscillatory (see figure 8). We will now repeat the analysis of sections 6.1 and 6.2 for this case. Our discussion will be rather brief, since many aspects are very similar.

![](_page_56_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 11: The ratio of the quantum volumes V (1) 12,1 and the asymptotic formula (6.20) for different values of b.

The one-instanton contribution. In this case, the extrema are located at

$$E_{k}^{*}=-\frac{k^{2}}{4}\,\quad k\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq1}.\tag{6.25}$$

They do not carry a subscript '+' or '−', since both cases coincide. In particular, all extrema of V (b=1) eff have vanishing second derivative. Thus in the saddle point evaluation of the integral (6.7), we have to go to subleading order in the integral. We take the contour to be a steepest descent contour in the complex plane. Only the imaginary part of the one-instanton contribution is unambiguous since the real part depends on the precise details of the contour. We have

V (1) n (S0; P1, . . . , Pn) [1] k = iIm Z γk dE −1 8πE∗ k e −V (1) eff (E∗ k )− 1 6 (E−E∗ k ) 3 (V (b) eff ) ′′′(E∗ k ) × Yn j=1 √ 2 sinh(4πPj p −E∗ k ) Pj = − i e −V (1) eff (E∗ k ) Γ( 1 3 ) 8πE∗ k − 4 √ 3(V (1) eff ) ′′′(E∗ k ) 1 3 Yn j=1 √ 2 sinh(4πPj p −E∗ k ) Pj = i e −2 √ 2kπe S0 Γ( 1 3 ) 8π 2k (4√ 6 eS0 ) 1 3 Yn j=1 √ 2 sinh(2πkPj ) Pj . (6.26)

Large genus asymptotics. To extract the large genus behaviour of the quantum volumes V (1) g,n, we proceed as above. Matching (6.17) and (6.26) with k = 1 yields the asymptotics

$${\sf V}^{(1)}_{g,n}(P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})\stackrel{{g\gg1}}{{\sim}}\frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{3})\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi P_{j})}{P_{j}}}{2^{\frac{2}{3}}3^{\frac{3}{6}}\pi^{\frac{2}{3}}}\left(\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}\pi}\right)^{2g-2+n}\Gamma\big{(}2g-\frac{7}{3}+n\big{)}.\tag{6.27}$$

Note that these quantum volumes grow slightly faster than the generic volumes, which is consistent with the fact that (6.20) diverges at b = 1. (6.27) is again consistent with the dilaton and the string equations (4.15a) and (4.15b), but we are not aware of simple checks beyond these.

## 7 Worldsheet string perturbation theory

In this section, we will study the Virasoro minimal string (1.1) directly using worldsheet string perturbation theory. As emphasized in the introduction and in figure 2, we interpret string diagrams as computing quantum volumes of the worldsheet, rather than in terms of amplitudes of asymptotic string states in target spacetime.

### 7.1 Torus one-point diagram

In string perturbation theory, the torus one-point diagram is evaluated as

$${\sf V}_{1,1}^{({\sf b})}(P_{1})=\frac{(2\pi)^{2}}{2}\int_{F_{0}}{\sf d}^{2}\tau\left\langle{\sf b}\,\widehat{\sf b}\,{\cal V}_{P_{1}}(0)\right\rangle_{g=1}\tag{7.1}$$ $$={\sf N}\,\frac{(2\pi)^{2}}{2}\int_{F_{0}}{\sf d}^{2}\tau\left|\eta(\tau)\right|^{4}\!\left\langle V_{P_{1}}(0)\right\rangle_{g=1}\!\left\langle\widehat{V}_{iP_{1}}(0)\right\rangle_{g=1}\,,$$

where F0 = {τ ∈ C| − 1 2 ≤ Re τ ≤ 1 2 , |τ | ≥ 1} is the fundamental domain of the torus moduli space, and where we used the definition (2.6) for the physical vertex operators and the fact that the normalization N(P) is independent of P, see eq. (3.22). In our conventions, d 2 τ = dτ1dτ2 where τ = τ1 + iτ2. Contrary to the sphere, see eq. (3.22), we do not have to introduce an additional arbitrary normalization CT2 of the string path integral, since there is no corresponding counterterm on the torus and the normalization of the path integral is unambiguous and thus CT2 = 1. The factor of (2π) 2 in (7.1) arises from the correct normalization of the ghost path integral, see e.g. [120, section 7.3]. Finally, the factor of 1 2 arises from the fact that each torus has a Z2 symmetry and we need to divide by the order of the automorphism group.

In our conventions, the Liouville one-point correlation functions on the torus T2 with modulus τ in (7.1) admit the following Virasoro conformal block decompositions

 VP1 (0) g=1 = Z ∞ 0 dP ρ(b) 0 (P)Cb(P1, P, P)F (b) 1,1 (P1; P|q)F (b) 1,1 (P1; P|q) , (7.2a)

$$\left\langle\widehat{V}_{iP_{1}}(0)\right\rangle_{g=1}=\int_{\cal C}{\rm d}\widehat{P}\frac{(i\widehat{P})^{2}}{2\rho_{0}^{(b)}(i\widehat{P})}\,\widehat{C}_{b}(iP_{1},\widehat{P},\widehat{P}){\cal F}_{1,1}^{(b)}(iP_{1};\widehat{P}|q){\cal F}_{1,1}^{(b)}(iP_{1};\widehat{P}|\overline{q})\,\tag{7.2b}$$

where F (b) 1,1 (P1; P|q) is the holomorphic torus one-point Virasoro conformal block at central charge c = 1 + 6(b + b −1 ) 2 with external weight hP1 = 1 4 (b + b −1 ) 2 + P 2 1 and internal weight hP = 1 4 (b + b −1 ) 2 + P 2 , evaluated at a value of the parameter q = e2πiτ where τ is the modulus of the torus. The contour of integration C over the intermediate states with Liouville momentum Pb in the ˆc ≤ 1 torus one-point function (7.2b) is chosen as depicted in figure 5.

The torus one-point Virasoro conformal block F (b) 1,1 (P1; P|q) can be expressed as [121,122]

$${\cal F}^{(b)}_{1,1}(P_{1};P|q)=q^{P^{2}-\frac{1}{24}}\left(\prod_{m=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{1-q^{m}}\right){\cal H}^{(b)}_{1,1}(P_{1};P|q)\,\tag{7.3}$$

where the so-called elliptic conformal block H (b) 1,1 (P1; P|q) admits a power series expansion in q that starts at 1 and that can be computed efficiently with a recursion relation in the internal weight hP , as briefly reviewed in appendix C.2. Decomposing the Liouville one-point functions in (7.1) into Virasoro conformal blocks and making use of (7.3) we obtain that the torus one-point diagram in Virasoro minimal string theory takes the form,

$$\mathsf{V}_{1,1}^{(b)}(P_{1})=\mathrm{N}\,\frac{(2\pi)^{2}}{2}\int_{F_{0}}\mathrm{d}^{2}\tau\int_{0}^{\infty}\mathrm{d}P\,\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)C_{b}(P_{1},P,P)|q|^{2P^{2}}\mathcal{H}_{1,1}^{(b)}(P_{1};P|q)\mathcal{H}_{1,1}^{(b)}(P_{1};P|\overline{q})$$ $$\times\int_{\mathcal{C}}\mathrm{d}\widehat{P}\,\frac{(i\widehat{P})^{2}}{2\rho_{0}^{(b)}(i\widehat{P})}\widehat{C}_{b}(iP_{1},\widehat{P},\widehat{P})|q|^{2P^{2}}\mathcal{H}_{1,1}^{(b)}(iP_{1};\widehat{P}|q)\mathcal{H}_{1,1}^{(b)}(iP_{1};\widehat{P}|\overline{q}).\tag{7.4}$$

As discussed in section 3, an interesting feature of the Virasoro minimal string background (1.1) is that string diagrams in string perturbation theory are manifestly finite for any physical value of the external momenta of the closed strings. This is in contrast to more familiar string backgrounds in which divergences arise in degenerating limits of moduli space and the string diagram (for example, a string S-matrix element) is typically defined via analytic continuation from unphysical values of the external closed string momenta for which the string diagram moduli space integral converges [120].

Analytic evaluation of V (b) 1,1 (P1) for two special values of P1. There are a couple of cases in which the torus one-point Virasoro conformal block is known explicitly, for all values of the central charge. The most obvious is the case in which the external operator is the identity, with P1 = iQ 2 , in which case the conformal block is simply given by the corresponding non-degenerate Virasoro character with (internal) weight P,

$${\cal F}_{1,1}^{(b)}\big{(}P_{1}=\frac{iQ}{2};P|\tau\big{)}=\chi_{P}^{(b)}(\tau)=\frac{{\rm e}^{2\pi i\tau P^{2}}}{\eta(\tau)}.\tag{7.5}$$

The second case is less obvious. It turns out that when the external weight is equal to one, with P1 = i 2 (b −1−b) = iQb 2 , then the torus-one point block is also given by the non-degenerate Virasoro character [123]

$${\cal F}_{1,1}^{(b)}\big{(}P_{1}=\frac{i\hat{Q}}{2};P|\tau\big{)}=\chi_{P}^{(b)}(\tau).\tag{7.6}$$

In other words, in both cases the elliptic conformal block (7.3) is precisely equal to one, H (b) 1,1 (P1; P|q) = 1 for P1 = iQ 2 and P1 = iQb 2 . In both these cases, P1 ̸∈ R. But these values still fall in the range of analyticity of V (b) g,n since the contour in the conformal block decomposition does not need to be deformed; see section 3.1.

For the case P1 = iQb 2 , using the following limit of the three-point coefficient

$$C_{b}(\frac{i\bar{Q}}{2},P,P)=\frac{2P^{2}}{\pi Q\rho_{0}(P)}\,\tag{7.7}$$

as well as (3.6), we obtain that the torus one-point diagram (7.4) evaluates to,

V (b) 1,1 (P1 = iQb 2 ) = N (2π) 2 2 Z F0 d 2 τ Z ∞ 0 dP ρ(b) 0 (P)Cb( iQb 2 , P, P) e−4πτ2P 2 × Z C dPb (iPb) 2 2ρ (b) 0 (iPb) Cbb( Qb 2 , P , b Pb) e−4πτ2Pb2 = N (2π) 2 2 Z F0 d 2 τ Z ∞ 0 dP P2 e −4πτ2P 2 Z ∞ −∞ dPb 2 e −4πτ2Pb2 = N(2π) 2 2 1 128π Z F0 d 2 τ τ −2 2 = N π 2 192 . (7.8)

This precisely agrees with (2.19b) evaluated at P1 = iQb 2 , provided that

$${\rm N}=\frac{4}{\pi^{2}}.\tag{7.9}$$

Therefore, making use of (3.22) we obtain that

$$C_{\rm S^{2}}=\frac{\pi^{6}}{64}.\tag{7.10}$$

The torus one-point diagram in the case P = iQ 2 proceeds essentially identically, except that slightly more care is required in taking the limit. The issue is that the relevant structure constant diverges in this limit

$$C_{b}(i(\frac{Q}{2}-\varepsilon),P,P)=\frac{1}{\pi\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)}\,\varepsilon^{-1}+O(\varepsilon^{0})\,.\tag{7.11}$$

For this reason the spacelike Liouville correlator diverges and the timelike Liouville correlator vanishes but the combination that appears on the worldsheet remains finite. We find that

$${\sf V}_{1,1}^{(b)}(P_{1}=\frac{iQ}{2})={\rm N}\frac{(2\pi)^{2}}{2}\int_{F_{0}}{\rm d}^{2}\tau\int_{0}^{\infty}{\rm d}P\,{\rm e}^{-4\pi\tau_{2}P^{2}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{{\rm d}\widehat{P}}{2}\,(-\widehat{P}^{2})\,{\rm e}^{-4\pi\tau_{2}\widehat{P}^{2}}\tag{7.12}$$ $$=-{\rm N}\,\frac{\pi^{2}}{192}\,$$

which also exactly agrees with (2.19b) evaluated at P1 = iQ 2 provided (7.9) is satisfied.

Direct numerical evaluation of V (b) 1,1 (P1) for generic values of P1. Let us first be more explicit about the behavior of the torus one-point diagram (7.4) near the cusp τ2 → ∞ of the fundamental domain. In this limit, since to leading order at large τ2 the torus one-point elliptic conformal blocks H (b) 1,1 (P1; P|q) ≃ 1, the moduli integral of (7.4) behaves as

$$\int^{\infty}{\rm d}\tau_{2}\int_{0}^{\infty}{\rm d}P\ \rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)C_{b}(P_{1},P,P)\,{\rm e}^{-4\pi\tau_{2}P^{2}}\int_{\cal C}{\rm d}\widehat{P}\ \frac{(i\widehat{P})^{2}}{2\rho_{0}^{(b)}(i\widehat{P})}\,\widehat{C}_{b}(iP_{1},\widehat{P},\widehat{P})\,{\rm e}^{-4\pi\tau_{2}P^{2}}.\tag{7.13}$$

In the limit τ2 → ∞, the integrals over the intermediate Liouville momenta P and Pb are dominated by their values near P = 0 and Pb = 0. Using Laplace's method, we can approximate these integrals as an asymptotic expansion at large τ2 by

Z ∞ 0 dP ρ(b) 0 (P)Cb(P1, P, P) e−4πτ2P 2 ∼ X n∈2Z≥0 2 −2(n+1)π − n 2 Γ(n 2 + 1) τ − n+1 2 2 d n dP n     P =0 ρ (b) 0 (P)Cb(P1, P, P) , (7.14a) Z C dPb (iPb) 2 2ρ (b) 0 (iPb) Cbb(iP1, P , b Pb) e−4πτ2Pb2 ∼ X m∈2Z≥0 2 −2m−1)π − m 2 Γ(m 2 + 1) τ − m+1 2 2 d m dPbm     Pˆ=0 (iPb) 2 2ρ (b) 0 (iPb) Cbb(iP1, P , b Pb) . (7.14b)

For instance, the first nonzero terms in the asymptotic expansions are the m = 0 and n = 2 terms on the RHS of (7.14), from which we obtain that the moduli integral (7.13) behaves

$28\mathrm{S}$.

$$\frac{1}{128\pi}\int^{\infty}\!\!{\rm d}\tau_{2}\ \tau_{2}^{-2}\,\tag{7.15}$$

and is therefore convergent, as claimed in section 3.1.

In the direct numerical evaluation of (7.4), we will employ the strategy of [41]. We split the fundamental domain F0 of the torus moduli space into two regions: (I) τ ∈ F0 with τ2 ≤ τ max 2 , and (II) τ ∈ F0 with τ2 ≥ τ max 2 , for a sufficiently large value of τ max 2 . In region (I), we first perform the integrals over the intermediate Liouville momenta Pb and P separately and for a fixed value of τ . These two integrations are performed numerically with the elliptic conformal blocks H (ib) 1,1 (iP1; Pb|q) and H (b) 1,1 (P1; P|q) computed via the recursion relation (C.12) and truncated to order q 8 . The integration over τ in region (I) is then performed numerically. In region (II), we may approximate the moduli integrand by the expressions in (7.13) and (7.14); the moduli integral can then be done analytically. We include a sufficient number of terms in the asymptotic expansions (7.14) such that the resulting moduli integral over region (II) is accurate to order (τ max 2 ) −3 .

For the numerical evaluation of the torus one-point diagram, we will consider values of the Liouville parameter b such that b 2 is a rational number. As discussed in appendix C, for such values of b the Liouville three-point coefficients (3.1) and (3.6) can be expressed in terms of the Barnes G-function and thus their numerical implementation is much faster, as opposed to resorting to the integral representation of the Γb(x) function. For some rational values of b 2 , the numerical calculation of the torus one-point elliptic Virasoro conformal blocks H (b) 1,1 (P1; P|q) through the recursion relation (C.12) involves delicate cancellations. In order to avoid loss of precision, we compute the conformal blocks with a central charge corresponding to b = (m n ) 1 2 + δ and ˆb = (m n ) 1 2 + δ, with m, n ∈ Z≥1, with the choice of small δ = 10−7 for the c ≥ 25 and ˆc ≤ 1 Liouville CFT sectors, respectively. Lastly, in the numerical calculation of (7.4) we parametrize the contour of integration C over the intermediate ˆc ≤ 1 Liouville momentum by Pb = p + iϵ with p ∈ R and ϵ = 10−1 , and set τ max 2 = 15 in the splitting of the fundamental domain F0 described in the previous paragraph.

Figures 12 and 13 show numerical results for the torus one-point diagram (7.4) in Virasoro minimal string theory, with the fixed value (7.9) for the normalization constant N, computed with the strategy outlined above. Figure 12 shows results for the torus one-point diagram as a function of the external closed string momenta in the range P1 ∈ [0, 1], for the following four choices of the Liouville parameter b = 1, 2 − 1 2 , 3 − 1 2 , 4 − 1 2 . 17 Figure 13 shows results for the torus one-point diagram as a function of the spacelike Liouville CFT central charge in the range c ∈ [25, 26], for three choices of external closed string momenta P1 = 1 3 , 1 2 , 2 3 .

<sup>17</sup>The numerical results for b = 1 agree with those of [41], which followed a different normalization convention for the c = 25 and c = 1 Liouville CFT three-point coefficients.

Figure 12: Shown in dots are the numerical results for the torus one-point string diagram (7.4) in Virasoro minimal string theory for a range of external momentum P1 ∈ [0, 1] of the asymptotic closed string state, for the choice of the Liouville parameter b = 1, 2 − 1 2 , 3 − 1 2 , 4 − 1 2 as labeled in the plot. The exact result (7.16) is shown in the solid curve.

These numerical results exhibit a remarkable level of agreement with the exact result (2.19b)

$${\sf V}_{1,1}^{(b)}(P_{1})=\frac{1}{24}\left(\frac{c-13}{24}+P_{1}^{2}\right)\,\tag{7.16}$$

and provide a highly nontrivial direct check of the duality. The largest discrepancy between the numerical results shown in figure 12 and the exact result (7.16) is of order 10−4 % for b = 1, 2 − 1 2 and 10−3 % for b = 3− 1 2 , 4 − 1 2 . Likewise, the largest discrepancy between the numerical results in figure 13 and the function (7.16) is of order 10−4 %.

### 7.2 Sphere four-point diagram

Next, we consider the four-punctured sphere diagram in Virasoro minimal string theory. After using its conformal Killing group to fix the positions of three vertex operators Vj (zj , zj ) with j = 1, 3, 4 to z1 = 0, z3 = 1, and z4 = ∞, the sphere four-point diagram has one remaining modulus, the position z ∈ C of the last vertex operator V2(z, z), and takes the form

![](_page_63_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 13: Shown in dots are the numerical results for the torus one-point string diagram (7.4) in Virasoro minimal string theory for a fixed value of external momentum P1 = 1 3 , 1 2 , 2 3 of the asymptotic closed string state, as labeled in each curve, and for varying central charge c ∈ [25, 26]. Specifically, the data points calculated numerically correspond to b 2 = 9 10 , 5 6 , 4 5 , 7 9 , 3 4 , 8 11 , 5 7 , 7 10 , 9 13 , 2 3 for each value of P1. The exact result (7.16) is shown in the solid curve.

$$\mathsf{V}^{(0)}_{0,1}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4})=C_{\mathbb{S}^{2}}\mathbb{N}^{4}\int_{\mathbb{C}}\mathrm{d}^{2}z\left\langle V_{P_{1}}(0)V_{P_{2}}(z,\overline{z})V_{P_{3}}(1)V_{P_{4}}(\infty)\right\rangle_{g=0}$$ $$\times\left\langle\widehat{V}_{iP_{1}}(0)\widehat{V}_{iP_{2}}(z,\overline{z})\widehat{V}_{iP_{3}}(1)\widehat{V}_{iP_{4}}(\infty)\right\rangle_{g=0}.\tag{7.17}$$

The Liouville CFT sphere four-point functions in (7.17) admit the following Virasoro conformal block decompositions,

 VP1 (0)VP2 (z, z)VP3 (1)VP4 (∞) g=0 = Z ∞ 0 dP ρ(b) 0 (P)Cb(P1, P2, P)Cb(P3, P4, P) × F(b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4; P|z)F (b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4; P|z) , (7.18a) VbiP1 (0)VbiP2 (z, z)VbiP3 (1)VbiP4 (∞) g=0 = Z C dPb (iPb) 2 2ρ (b) 0 (iPb) Cbb(iP1, iP2, Pb)Cbb(iP3, iP4, Pb) × F(ib) 0,4 (iP1, iP2, iP3, iP4; Pb|z)F (ib) 0,4 (iP1, iP2, iP3, iP4; Pb|z) , (7.18b)

where F (b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4; P|z) is the sphere four-point holomorphic Virasoro conformal block with external weights hPi = Q2 4 + P 2 i for i = 1, . . . , 4, intermediate weight hP = Q2 4 + P 2 , evaluated at the cross-ratio z. Further, the conformal block F (b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4; P|z) can be expressed in terms of an elliptic conformal block H (b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4; P|q) as [124]

$${\cal F}^{(b)}_{0,4}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4};P|z)=(16q)^{\rho z}z^{-\frac{q^{2}}{4}-P_{4}^{2}-P_{4}^{2}}(1-z)^{-\frac{q^{2}}{4}-P_{2}^{2}-P_{3}^{2}}\theta_{3}(q)^{-Q^{2}-4(P_{1}^{2}+P_{2}^{2}+P_{3}^{2}+P_{4}^{2})}\tag{7.19}$$ $$\times{\cal H}^{(b)}_{0,4}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4};P|q)\,$$

where θ3(q) is a Jacobi theta function, and the elliptic nome q is related to the cross-ratio z by

$$q(z)=\exp\Big{(}-\pi\,\frac{K(1-z)}{K(z)}\Big{)}\,\qquad\mbox{where}K(z)={}_{2}F_{1}(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2};1|z).\tag{7.20}$$

The elliptic conformal block H (b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4; P|q) admits a power series expansion in q that can be efficiently computed via Zamolodchikov's recursion relation, as reviewed in appendix C.2. Whereas the conformal block expansion in the cross ratio z a priori converges only in the unit z-disk (|z| < 1), the expansion in the elliptic nome q variable converges everywhere inside the unit q-disk, which in particular covers the entire complex z-plane [125]. Furthermore, at any given point in the z-plane, the conformal block expansion in the q variable converges much faster.

The crossing symmetry relations of the ˆc ≤ 1 and c ≥ 25 Liouville CFT sphere four-point correlation functions (7.18), generated by (C.15) and (C.16), may be used to reduce the moduli integration of the four-point diagram (7.17) over the complex z-plane into a finite domain near z = 0 [126, 127]. We divide the complex z-plane into six regions: (1) Re z ≤ 1 2 , |1 − z| ≤ 1, (2) |z| ≤ 1, |1 − z| ≥ 1, (3) Re z ≤ 1 2 , |z| ≥ 1, (4) Re z ≥ 1 2 , |z| ≤ 1, (5) |1 − z| ≤ 1, |z| ≥ 1, and (6) Re z ≥ 1 2 , |1 − z| ≥ 1. Denoting the transformation z → 1 − z, for which (C.15) holds, by T and the transformation z → z −1 , for which (C.16) holds, by S, the regions (2)–(6) can be mapped to region (1) by the transformations ST S, T S, T, ST, S, respectively. Hence, the four-point string diagram (7.17) can be written as

$$\mathsf{V}_{0,4}^{(b)}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4})=C_{S^{2}}\mathrm{N}^{4}\int\limits_{\mathrm{reg}\,(1)}\mathrm{d}^{2}z\,\left[\left\langle\widehat{V}_{iP_{1}}(0)\widehat{V}_{iP_{2}}(z,\overline{z})\widehat{V}_{iP_{3}}(1)\widehat{V}_{iP_{4}}(\infty)\right\rangle_{g=0}\right.$$ $$\left.\times\left\langle V_{P_{1}}(0)V_{P_{2}}(z,\overline{z})V_{P_{3}}(1)V_{P_{4}}(\infty)\right\rangle_{g=0}\right.$$ $$\left.+\left(5\text{other perms of}\{123\}\right)\right]\,.\tag{7.21}$$

Lastly, performing a change of variable defined by

$$t=i\,\frac{K(1-z)}{K(z)}\,\tag{7.22}$$

![](_page_65_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 14: The fundamental domain in the cross ratio z-plane of the sphere four-point diagram, region (1) = {z ∈ C | Re z ≤ 1 2 , |1 − z| ≤ 1}, is mapped to the fundamental domain F0 = {t ∈ C | − 1 2 ≤ Re t ≤ 1 2 , |t| ≥ 1} in the complex t-plane via the change of variables (7.22).

from the cross-ratio z to the complex t-plane, such that the elliptic nome is q = eiπt, region (1) of the complex z-plane is mapped to the fundamental domain F0 = {t ∈ C | − 1 2 ≤ Re t ≤ 1 2 , |t| ≥ 1} in the complex t-plane. Decomposing the Liouville CFT four-point functions in (7.17) into Virasoro conformal blocks, making use of (7.19), performing the change of variables (7.22),18 and plugging in the constant values (7.9) and (7.10), we obtain that the four-point string diagram in Virasoro minimal string theory can be written as

V (b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4) = 4 Z F0 d 2 t Z ∞ 0 dP ρ(b) 0 (P)Cb(P1, P2, P)Cb(P3, P4, P) × |16q| 2P 2 H (b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4; P|q)H (b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4; P|q) × Z C dPb (iPb) 2 2ρ (b) 0 (iPb) Cbb(iP1, iP2, Pb)Cbb(iP3, iP4, Pb) × |16q| 2Pb2 H (ib) 0,4 (iP1, iP2, iP3, iP4; Pb|q)H (ib) 0,4 (iP1, iP2, iP3, iP4; Pb|q) + 5 other perms of {123} , (7.24)

As was the case for the torus one-point diagram considered in the previous section, the sphere four-point diagram takes the slightly simpler form (7.24) when expressed in terms of the elliptic Virasoro conformal blocks.

18The Jacobian of the map from the cross-ratio z to the elliptic nome q = eiπt

$$\left|\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}t}\right|^{2}=\left|\pi i\Big{(}\frac{\theta_{2}(q)\theta_{4}(q)}{\theta_{3}(q)}\Big{)}^{4}\right|^{2}\tag{7.23}$$

exactly cancels the combined prefactors appearing in the product of the conformal blocks (7.19).

Analytic evaluation of V (b=1) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4) for special values of Pi and b. Unlike the case of the torus one-point diagram, we are not aware of any value of the conformal weights for which we can compute both the timelike and spacelike Liouville CFT four-point functions exactly for any value of the central charge. However, for the special case of c = 25, or b = 1, with external weights all equal to hi = 15 16 , as well as for the case of c = 1, or b = i, with external weights all equal to hˆ i = 1 16 , the elliptic sphere four-point blocks (7.19) are known to be given simply by [128]

$${\cal H}^{(b=1)}_{0,4}(\,\frac{i}{4},\frac{i}{4},\frac{i}{4},\frac{i}{4};P|q)=1\,\qquad{\cal H}^{(b=i)}_{0,4}(\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4};\widehat{P}|q)=1\,\tag{7.25}$$

respectively. For this special case, and making use of

$$C_{b=1}(\frac{i}{4},\frac{i}{4},P)=\frac{2^{-\frac{11}{2}-4P^{2}}P}{\sinh(2\pi P)}\,\tag{7.26}$$

we obtain that the sphere four-point diagram (7.24) evaluates to

V (b=1) 0,4 ( i 4 , i 4 , i 4 , i 4 ) = 6 × 4 Z F0 d 2 t Z ∞ 0 dP ρ(b) 0 (P)C1( i 4 , i 4 , P) 2 2 8P 2 e −2πt2P 2 × Z C dPb (iPb) 2 2ρ (b) 0 (iPb) Cb1( i 4 , i 4 , Pb) 2 2 8Pb2 e −2πt2Pb2 = 24 Z F0 d 2 t Z ∞ 0 dP P2 e −2πt2P 2 Z ∞ −∞ dPb 2 e −2πt2Pb2 = 1 4 , (7.27)

which exactly agrees with (2.19a) evaluated at c = 25 with Pi = i 4 .

Direct numerical evaluation of V (b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4) for generic values of Pi and b. The behavior of each of the six terms in (7.24) near the cusp t2 → ∞ of the fundamental domain F0 in the complex t-plane, with t = t1 + it2, can be analyzed similarly to the case of the torus one-point diagram considered in the previous section. In the limit t2 → ∞, the sphere four-point elliptic conformal blocks H (b) 0,4 (Pi ; P|q) ≃ 1 and using Laplace's method we can approximate the ˆc ≤ 1 and c ≥ 25 Liouville correlation functions as an asymptotic expansion at large t2 by

$$\int_{0}^{\infty}\!{\rm d}P\,\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},P)C_{b}(P_{3},P_{4},P)\,{\rm e}^{-(2\pi t_{2}-8\log2)P^{2}}$$ $$\sim\sum_{n\in{\mathbb{Z}}_{2\geq0}}\frac{2^{-(n+1)}\pi^{\frac{1}{2}}(2\pi t_{2}-8\log2)^{-\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\Gamma(\frac{n}{2}+1)}\,\frac{{\rm d}^{n}}{{\rm d}P^{n}}\Big{|}_{P=0}\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)C(P_{1},P_{2},P)C(P_{3},P_{4},P)\,\tag{7.28a}$$

and similarly for the other five terms in (7.24). For example, taking the first nonzero terms in the asymptotic expansions (7.28) we obtain that the full moduli integral in the sphere four-point string diagram (7.24) behaves as

$$6\times\frac{1}{32\pi}\int^{\infty}{\rm d}t_{2}\ t_{2}^{-2}\,\tag{7.29}$$

and is therefore convergent, as discussed in section 3.1.

With the four-point sphere diagram written in the form (7.24), we can then follow precisely the same strategy of numerical integration that we employed in the computation of the torus one-point string diagram described in the previous section.19 We split the fundamental domain F0 in the complex t-plane into two regions: (I) t ∈ F0 with t2 ≤ t max 2 , where we first perform the integrals over the intermediate Liouville momenta P and Pb, and then over the modulus t numerically, and (II) t ∈ F0 with t2 ≥ t max 2 , where we use the asymptotic expansions of the form (7.28) and perform the moduli integral over t analytically, including a sufficient number of terms in the asymptotic expansions such that the resulting integral is accurate to order (t max 2 ) −4 . In the direct numerical evaluation of (7.24), we compute the elliptic conformal blocks H (b) 0,4 (Pi ; P|q) via the recursion relation (C.10) with a central charge corresponding to b = (m n ) 1 2 + δ and ˆb = (m n ) 1 2 + δ with m, n ∈ Z≥1 and the choice of small δ = 10−6 for the c ≥ 25 and ˆc ≤ 1 Liouville CFT sectors, respectively, both truncated to order q 8 ; parametrize the contour of integration C over the intermediate ˆc ≤ 1 Liouville momentum by Pb = p + iε with p ∈ R and ε = 10−1 ; and set t max 2 = 15.

For the direct numerical evaluation of the four-point string diagram (7.24) we will make the following choices for the external momenta of the asymptotic closed string states and for the Liouville parameter b of the c ≥ 25 Liouville CFT sector of the Virasoro minimal string

<sup>19</sup>In [40], the moduli integral of the sphere four-point diagram was numerically computed directly in the cross-ratio variable z ∈ region I, which led to less precise results compared to the computations performed in this paper. More importantly, [40] followed a different strategy in which the order of integrations is switched – first integrate over the cross-ratio z and then over the intermediate Liouville momenta P and Pb; this order proved to be more convenient in the numerical evaluation of string scattering amplitudes in two-dimensional string theory of [127, 129, 130]. With that order of integrations, it was necessary to introduce regulator counterterms to the moduli integral (7.21), which appears to have led to a systematic error in the numerical results for the sphere four-point diagram V (b) 0,4 . In the notation of equation (3.11) of [40], the results of the present paper are α = 8 and β = 16.

external closed string momenta (7.30), computed with the strategy outlined above, are shown in figure 15. We again find that the numerical results demonstrate a remarkable agreement with the exact form for the string four-point diagram (2.19a),

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{0,4}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4})=\frac{c-13}{24}+P_{1}^{2}+P_{2}^{2}+P_{3}^{2}+P_{4}^{2}.\tag{7.31}$$

This agreement provides again highly nontrivial evidence for our proposed duality. For the results presented in figure 15, the largest discrepancy between the numerical results in the data sets (7.30) and the exact result (7.31) is of order 10−4 % for b = 1, 2 − 1 2 and 10−3 % for b = 3− 1 2 , 4 − 1 2 .

### 7.3 Sphere partition function and other exceptional cases

So far, we have discussed V (b) g,n for 2g − 2 + n ≥ 0, where the moduli space Mg,n in (2.7) is well-defined. However, one can also discuss the remaining exceptional cases, which we do now. Especially on the sphere, this is subtle, because the volume of the conformal Killing vector group is infinite for n ≤ 2 and because of non-compactness of the worldsheet CFT the result is formally given by a ratio ∞ ∞. Our main tool is to assume that the dilaton (4.15a) and string equations (4.15b) continue to hold, which allows us to relate these lower-point functions to higher-point functions.

Torus partition function. Let us start with the torus partition function. The dilaton equation implies that the torus partition function diverges:

$$0\cdot{\sf V}^{(b)}_{1,0}={\sf V}^{(b)}_{1,1}(P=\frac{i\hat{Q}}{2})-{\sf V}^{(b)}_{1,1}(P=\frac{iQ}{2})=\frac{1}{24}\neq0.\tag{7.32}$$

Since the right-hand-side is non-zero, this implies that the torus partition function is infinite. This can also be checked directly from the worldsheet and is a reflection of the fact that the torus partition function of Liouville theory diverges.

Sphere two-point function. The sphere two-point function needs to satisfy the dilaton equation, but this does not give any non-trivial information. Instead, we observe from the worldsheet definition (2.7) that the two-point functions on the worldsheet are only nonvanishing for P1 = P2 and thus we necessarily have20

${\rm V}^{(b)}_{0,2}(P_{1},P_{2})=F(P_{1})\delta(P_{1}-P_{2})$.

<sup>20</sup>The worldsheet two-point function is actually proportional to δ(P1 − P2) 2 , since we get a delta-function from both spacelike and timelike Liouville theory. The square in the delta-function can then get cancelled by the infinite volume of the conformal Killing vector group [131].

We can fix F(P1) by looking at the string equation (4.15b)

$$1=\sum_{j=1}^{2}\int_{0}^{P_{j}}2P_{j}\,{\rm d}P_{j}\ {\sf V}_{0,2}^{(b)}(P_{1},P_{2})\,\tag{7.34}$$

which fixes

$${\sf V}_{0,2}^{(b)}(P_{1},P_{2})=\frac{1}{2P_{1}}\,\delta(P_{1}-P_{2})=\delta(h_{1}-h_{2})\,\tag{7.35}$$

where we expressed it in terms of the conformal weight in the last step. This could have been expected from the spacetime picture, since we can obtain a double-trumpet either by gluing two trumpets or by using eq. (2.18) for g = 0 and n = 2. Thus the two-point volume should be just a delta-function in the natural measure 2P dP. We also would have concluded this from the inverse Laplace transform of the resolvent R (b) 0,2 (5.9).

Sphere one-point function. The one-point function on the sphere can be obtained directly from (7.35) via the dilaton equation (4.15a). We have

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{0,1}(P)={\sf V}^{(b)}_{0,2}(P,\frac{iQ}{2})-{\sf V}^{(b)}_{0,2}(P,\frac{iQ}{2})=\delta(h)-\delta(h-1).\tag{7.36}$$

This could again be expected from the disk partition function, since gluing a trumpet to this object according to (2.18) gives back the disk partition function (2.16a). In particular, for states in the spectrum for which P > 0, the one-point function on the sphere vanishes. Vanishing of the generic sphere one-point function was anticipated in [41] based on the well-behavedness of the string perturbation expansion.

Sphere partition function. Finally, the zero-point function on the sphere follows again from the dilaton equation:

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{0,0}=\frac{1}{2}\big{(}{\sf V}^{(b)}_{0,1}(\frac{iQ}{2})-{\sf V}^{(b)}_{0,1}(\frac{iQ}{2})\big{)}=\frac{1}{2}\big{(}\delta(0)+\delta(0)\big{)}=\infty.\tag{7.37}$$

Like the torus partition function, also the sphere partition is divergent. This feature is also believed to be a property of JT gravity [132, 133].

## 8 Asymptotic boundaries and ZZ-instantons

In this section we elucidate the worldsheet boundary conditions needed to describe configurations with asymptotic boundaries in Virasoro minimal string theory. We will see that this involves pairing a non-standard basis of FZZT branes for spacelike Liouville CFT described in section 3.2 together with ZZ-like boundary conditions (a good choice turns out to be the "half-ZZ" branes introduced in section 3.2) for timelike Liouville CFT. Equipped with these boundary conditions, we will then derive the disk and trumpet partition functions (given in equations (2.16a) and (2.16b) respectively), as well as the double-trumpet partition function directly from the worldsheet BCFT. We then proceed to investigate non-perturbative effects mediated by ZZ-instantons on the worldsheet. In particular, we determine the normalization of the one-instanton contributions to the free energy, finding a perfect match with the matrix integral as computed in section 6.1. Finally, we compute the leading non-perturbative corrections to the quantum volumes as mediated by ZZ-instantons.

### 8.1 Asymptotic boundaries

We now discuss the incorporation of asymptotically Euclidean AdS boundaries to Virasoro minimal string theory through conformal boundary conditions for the worldsheet CFT. The quantum volumes V (b) g,n(P1, . . . , Pn) computed by closed string perturbation theory as in (2.7) correspond to configurations with n geodesic boundaries with lengths that are given in the JT limit (b → 0) by [134]

$\ell_{i}=4\pi bP_{i}$.

In order to introduce asymptotic boundaries, we glue "trumpets" — punctured disks with boundary conditions to be described shortly — onto the string diagrams with finite boundaries as described in section 2.5. The punctures are labelled by a Liouville momentum Pi and create finite boundaries (which are to be glued onto those of the quantum volumes), with lengths that in the JT limit are given by (8.1). Then what we seek is a boundary condition for the worldsheet CFT corresponding to an asymptotic boundary with fixed (renormalized) length βi .

As reviewed in section 3.2, Liouville CFT admits two main families of conformal boundary conditions. In order to develop some intuition for them and their interpretation in Virasoro minimal string theory, recall that the Virasoro minimal string admits a reformulation in terms of two-dimensional dilaton gravity defined in (2.1), where the dilaton and Weyl factor of the target space metric can be recast in terms of the spacelike and timelike Liouville fields ϕ and χ as in (2.2). The one-parameter family of FZZT branes [84,85] admit a semiclassical reformulation in terms of a modified Neumann boundary condition for the Liouville fields, and hence may heuristically be thought of as extended branes. In contrast, the ZZ conformal boundary conditions [83] may semiclassically be thought of as Dirichlet boundary conditions for the Liouville field and hence represent localized branes. Indeed, as reviewed in section 3.2, the open-string spectrum of the cylinder partition functions with FZZT boundary conditions is continuous, while it is discrete for the ZZ-type boundary conditions.

Thus in order to introduce asymptotic boundaries in Virasoro minimal string theory, we will need to equip the spacelike and timelike Liouville sectors of the worldsheet CFT with a suitable combination of FZZT and ZZ-type boundary conditions. In particular, we claim that an ansatz that correctly reproduces matrix integral results is to equip the spacelike Liouville theory with FZZT boundary conditions and the timelike Liouville theory with the "half-ZZ" boundary conditions introduced in section 3.2.

Let us first discuss the FZZT boundary conditions for spacelike Liouville theory. Recall that the FZZT branes are labeled by a continuous parameter s. We claim that fixing the renormalized length of the asymptotic boundary is achieved by working in a basis of FZZT boundary states that is Laplace-dual to the fixed-s basis, as

$$\int_{0}^{\infty}\!{\rm d}s\,{\rm e}^{-\beta s^{2}}\,|{\rm FZ}{\rm T}^{(b)}(s)\rangle\,\,\,.\tag{8.2}$$

Heuristically, since s labels the Liouville momentum of an open string stretched between FZZT and ZZ branes, we think of s 2 as an energy and the Laplace transform as implementing the change to an ensemble of fixed β.

Having fixed the renormalized boundary length with FZZT-like boundary conditions on the spacelike Liouville theory, fixing the asymptotic value of the dilaton as usual in dilaton gravity requires ZZ-like (Dirichlet) boundary conditions for the timelike Liouville theory. Indeed, any of the "half-ZZ" boundary conditions described in section 3.2 is sufficient, when paired with a suitable modification of the FZZT BCFT data for the spacelike Liouville CFT. Following previous literature on Liouville gravity (although our prescription varies significantly in the details, see e.g. [38]), we think of the resulting combined boundary condition as introducing a "marked" disk in Virasoro minimal string theory. The idea is that in string theory equipped with worldsheet boundaries one computes partition functions on unmarked disks, in the sense that translations along the boundary circle are gauged (there is no marked reference point). To undo the effect of the gauging, one should multiply by the volume of translations along the boundary. This is how we interpret the necessary modification of the FZZT boundary state to be described presently.

For example, suppose we equip the timelike Liouville theory with (m, ±) "half-ZZ" boundary conditions. Then we claim that the FZZT boundary conditions on the spacelike Liouville theory should be modified so that the disk one-point function is given by

$$\Psi^{(b)}(s;P)\rightarrow\Psi^{(b)}_{(m,\pm)}(s;P)\equiv\frac{P\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)}{\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi m b^{\pm1}P)}\Psi^{(b)}(s;P)\;,\tag{8.3}$$

where the unmarked one-point function Ψ(b) is given in (3.32). This redefinition is independent of the FZZT brane parameter s so the transformation to the fixed-length basis is unaffected.

To summarize, we claim that the worldsheet boundary conditions that introduce an asymptotic boundary of fixed renormalized length β involve combining the Laplace transform of the marked FZZT boundary conditions for spacelike Liouville CFT with the corresponding half-ZZ boundary conditions for timelike Liouville CFT:

$$\int_{0}^{\infty}\!{\rm d}s\,{\rm e}^{-\beta s^{2}}\,|{\rm FZZ}\Gamma^{(b)}_{(m,\pm)}(s)\rangle\otimes|\widehat{Z}\widehat{Z}^{(ib)}_{(m,\pm)}\rangle\;\;,\tag{8.4}$$

where the subscript on the FZZT boundary state indicates the marking. In what follows we will see that all choices of (m, ±) are in a sense BRST-equivalent.

We note that both the transformation from the fixed-s to the fixed-length basis (8.2) and the marking prescription (8.3) differ substantially from the conventions adopted in previous work on the minimal string. Nevertheless, we will see that the combined BCFTs define the correct conformal boundary conditions that match with the matrix integral.

In particular, the energy in the dual matrix model will be identified with s 2 instead of cosh(2πbs) as is the case e.g. in the minimal string. In those cases, this relation can be motivated from the path integral, but we do not have a sufficiently good understanding of the boundary conditions of timelike Liouville theory to perform such a derivation here. Instead, we remark that the identification of the energy with s 2 is uniquely fixed by requiring that the density of states computed from the disk partition function matches with the spectral curve given in eq. (5.15). We also remark that this identification is quite natural in this context given that from the definition of the FZZT parameter in (3.31) s 2 is the conformal weight in the open-string channel, which is the energy in the Virasoro algebra.

Punctured disk diagram: the trumpet and the disk. We start by computing the trumpet partition function in Virasoro minimal string theory directly from the worldsheet BCFT. The starting point for this computation is the punctured disk diagram, with FZZT boundary conditions on the spacelike Liouville sector and (say) (m, ±) half-ZZ boundary conditions on the timelike Liouville sector. Figure 16 summarizes the relationship between the punctured disk diagram and the trumpet partition function in Virasoro minimal string theory. Taking into account the prescription (8.3), the marked disk diagram is given by the following product of disk one-point functions

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm dik}(s;P)=\widetilde{C}_{\rm D^{2}}{\rm N}\Psi^{(b)}_{(m,\pm)}(s;P)\widetilde{\Psi}^{(ib)}_{(m,\pm)}(P)\tag{8.5}$$ $$=\widetilde{C}_{\rm D^{2}}{\rm N}\,\frac{P\rho^{(b)}_{0}(P)}{\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi mb^{\pm1}P)}\frac{2\sqrt{2}\cos(4\pi sP)}{\rho^{(b)}_{0}(P)}\frac{4\sinh(2\pi mb^{\pm1}P)}{P}$$ $$=2\sqrt{2}\widetilde{C}_{\rm D^{2}}{\rm N}\times2\sqrt{2}\cos(4\pi sP)\,$$

Figure 16: The Laplace transform of the (marked) disk one-point diagram of an on-shell vertex operator VP subject to FZZT(s) boundary conditions in the spacelike Liouville sector and half-ZZ boundary conditions in the timelike Liouville sector of the Virasoro minimal string theory computes the partition function of a "trumpet" with Liouville momentum P and an asymptotic boundary of renormalized length β.

where Ψb(iˆb) (m,±) is given in (3.36) and we used (2.5) and (2.6). Here, Ce D2 is the normalization of the string theory path integral; the tilde indicates that it also includes the volume of the residual U(1) automorphism group of the punctured disk. Equation (8.5) is equivalent to the modular S matrix that decomposes a Virasoro character with Liouville momentum s into a complete basis of characters in the dual channel with Liouville momenta P.

The trumpet partition function, with an asymptotic boundary of renormalized length β, is then given by the Laplace transform (8.2) of the marked disk one-point function (8.5):

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm trumpet}(\beta;P)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!{\rm d}s\,{\rm e}^{-\beta s^{2}}Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(s;P)=2\sqrt{2}\widetilde{C}_{\rm D^{2}}{\rm N}\times\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\beta}}\,{\rm e}^{-\frac{4\pi^{2}p^{2}}{\beta}}.\tag{8.6}$$

As explained in sections 2.5 and 4.4, this should be nothing but the Virasoro character of a primary of conformal weight hP in the dual channel (with modulus τ = 2πi β ) with the contributions of the descendants stripped off. This fixes the normalization

$$\widetilde{C}_{\rm D^{2}}=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}{\rm N}}=\frac{\pi^{2}}{8\sqrt{2}}\,\tag{8.7}$$

where we used that N is given by (7.9). We can then recognize that

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm trumpet}(\beta;P)=\eta\left(\frac{i\beta}{2\pi}\right)\chi^{(b)}_{P}\left(\frac{2\pi i}{\beta}\right).\tag{8.8}$$

This is because the partition function of the Virasoro minimal string on the disk is equivalent to that of (the chiral half of) 3d gravity on the solid cylinder, which computes the corresponding Virasoro character. We get the character in the dual channel because the length of the thermal circle in 3d gravity is related to the length of the boundary disk by a modular S transformation, see section 4.4. Up to an overall scale factor, this is actually equivalent to the trumpet partition function of JT gravity for all values of b (where P is related to the geodesic length as in (2.22) and the inverse temperature is rescaled as in (2.23)).

The empty disk diagram. To compute the empty disk diagram in Virasoro minimal string theory, and hence the disk partition function, we appeal to the dilaton equation (4.15a). The dilaton equation implies that the empty (marked) disk diagram is given by the following difference of punctured disk diagrams

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(s;P=\frac{iQ}{2})-Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(s;P=\frac{i\hat{Q}}{2})=\rho^{(b)}_{0}(s).\tag{8.9}$$

Thus the disk partition function in Virasoro minimal string theory is given by

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(\beta)=\int_{0}^{\infty}{\rm d}s\ {\rm e}^{-\beta s^{2}}\rho^{(b)}_{0}(s)=\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\beta}}\left({\rm e}^{\frac{s^{2}\phi^{2}}{\beta}}-{\rm e}^{\frac{s^{2}\phi^{2}}{\beta}}\right)=\eta\left(\frac{i\beta}{2\pi}\right)\chi^{(b)}_{(1,1)}\left(\frac{2\pi i}{\beta}\right).\tag{8.10}$$

As indicated in the last line, this is equivalent to the Virasoro vacuum character in the dual channel with the descendant-counting eta function stripped off.

Figure 17: The Laplace transform of the cylinder diagram in Virasoro minimal string theory with FZZT(s1) and FZZT(s2) boundary conditions together with half-ZZ boundary conditions on the two ends computes the partition function on the double-trumpet, with asymptotic boundaries of renormalized lengths β1 and β2.

Cylinder diagram: the double-trumpet. We now discuss the computation of the double-trumpet partition function from the worldsheet in Virasoro minimal string theory. We start by considering the cylinder diagram with (s1, s2) FZZT boundary conditions on the spacelike Liouville theory and any combination of half-ZZ boundary conditions on the timelike Liouville theory, subject to the marking prescription (8.3). For concreteness in what follows we will put (m, +) and (n, +) half-ZZ boundary conditions on the timelike Liouville CFT, but we emphasize that the analysis for any other combination proceeds similarly. The relationship between the cylinder diagram and the double-trumpet partition function is recapitulated in figure 17. The (marked) cylinder diagram is computed as the following integral of the cylinder partition functions of the ghost, spacelike Liouville and timelike Liouville CFTs over the modulus t 21

Z (b) cylinder(s1, s2) = Z ∞ 0 dt η(it) 2 Z ∞ 0 dP ρ(b) 0 (P) Ψ(b) (m,+)(s1; P)Ψ(b) (n,+)(s2; P)χ (b) P (it)Z (ib) (m,+;n,+)(t) = √ 2 Z ∞ 0 dt Z ∞ 0 dP η(it) 2 cos(4πs1P) cos(4πs2P) sinh(2πbP) sinh(2πb−1P) χ (b) P (it) × mX +n−1 r 2=|m−n|+1 X∞ s 2=1 χ (ib) (r,s) ( i t ) P ρ(b) 0 (P) √ 2 sinh(2πmbP) ! P ρ(b) 0 (P) √ 2 sinh(2πnbP) ! , (8.11)

where Z (ib) (m,+;n,+) is given in (3.37). We then exchange the integral over the cylinder modulus with that over the Liouville momentum P and use the following identity22

$$\sum_{r\geq|m-n|+1}^{m+n-1}\sum_{s\geq1}^{\infty}\int_{0}^{\infty}\!{\rm d}t\,\eta(it)^{2}\chi_{P}^{(b)}(it)\chi_{(r,s)}^{(b)}(\frac{i}{t})=\frac{\sinh(2\pi nb|P|)\sinh(2\pi nb|P|)}{\sqrt{2}|P|\sinh(2\pi b|P|)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}|P|)}\,\tag{8.12}$$

where the characters are defined in (3.25) and (3.27) respectively. We then arrive at the following simple expression for the cylinder diagram

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm cylinder}(s_{1},s_{2})=\int_{0}^{\infty}(2P\,{\rm d}P)\left(2\sqrt{2}\cos(4\pi s_{1}P)\right)\times\left(2\sqrt{2}\cos(4\pi s_{2}P)\right)\,.\tag{8.13}$$

Notice that this is entirely independent of b. This universality is expected given the duality with the double-scaled matrix integral. Indeed, although formally divergent as written, it is as expected simply the result of gluing two punctured disk diagrams (corresponding to trumpet partition functions in the fixed-length basis) together with the measure 2P dP. This also justifies our marking procedure given by (8.3). A similar calculation leads to the same result for the (m, +; n, −) and (m, −; n, −) assignment of half-ZZ boundary conditions for the timelike Liouville sector.

<sup>21</sup>Here we consider a cylinder of length πt and unit radius. We should also note that there is no counterterm on the annulus since it admits a flat metric. Thus there is no need to introduce a further arbitrary normalization CA2 .

<sup>22</sup>In arriving at this identity we have implicitly assumed that b 2 < 1 m−n+1 . For n = m this is always satisfied for the relevant values of the central charge.

The double-trumpet partition function Z (b) 0,2 in Virasoro minimal string theory is computed by transforming the marked cylinder diagram (8.11) to the fixed-length basis via the Laplace transform (8.2). We find the following universal result

$$Z^{(b)}_{0,2}(\beta_{1},\beta_{2})=\int_{0}^{\infty}\!{\rm d}s_{1}\int_{0}^{\infty}\!{\rm d}s_{2}\,{\rm e}^{-\beta_{1}s_{1}^{2}-\beta_{2}s_{2}^{2}}Z^{(b)}_{\rm cylinder}(s_{1},s_{2})\tag{8.14}$$ $$=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\beta_{1}\beta_{2}}}\int_{0}^{\infty}(2P\,{\rm d}P)\,{\rm e}^{-4\pi^{2}P^{2}\left(\frac{1}{\beta_{1}}+\frac{1}{\beta_{2}}\right)}=\frac{\sqrt{\beta_{1}\beta_{2}}}{2\pi(\beta_{1}+\beta_{2})}\.$$

This is of course equivalent to the result of gluing two trumpet partition functions according to (2.18).

Let us remark that the final results in this section are always independent in the end of the choice of (m, ±) for the half-ZZ boundary condition in the timelike Liouville sector. We take this to mean that these boundary conditions, while different in the worldsheet theory, are equivalent in the full string theory, i.e. after taking the BRST cohomology on the worldsheet. For the case of the minimal string, a similar phenomenon occurs [30].

### 8.2 ZZ-instantons on the worldsheet

We now turn our attention towards the computation of non-perturbative corrections to the partition function.23 As anticipated in section 6.1 from the matrix integral, they are given by ZZ-instantons on the worldsheet. We shall discuss the case b ̸= 1, since the case b = 1 has further zero-modes and is much more subtle.

We shall start by discussing the appropriate boundary conditions for such ZZ-instantons. The boundary condition should not involve any continuous parameters and thus the most general choice is to take the direct product of boundary states

$${\rm ZZ}^{(b)}_{(m,n)}\rangle\otimes|\widehat{\rm ZZ}^{(ib)}_{(k,\pm)}\rangle\ \,\tag{8.15}$$

which were introduced in section 3.2. We shall later restrict attention to a subset of these.

The quantum volume V (b) g,n(P1, . . . , Pn) receives non-perturbative corrections of order exp(−e S0 ) from each ZZ-instanton boundary condition, which themselves admit a perturbative expansion schematically of the form

$$\exp\left(\bigodot+\bigodot+\bigodot\bigodot+\bigodot\bigodot+\cdots\right)$$

<sup>23</sup>This matching of the leading non-perturbative effects in the Virasoro matrix integral to those of half-ZZ instantons on the string worldsheet has been independently observed by [135].

$$\times\left[\left(\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[height=36.135pt]{0.0pt}\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[height=36.135pt]{0.0pt}\end{array}\right)\cdot\left(\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[height=36.135pt]{0.0pt}\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[height=36.135pt]{0.0pt}\end{array}\right)\cdot\left(\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[height=36.135pt]{0.0pt}\end{array}\right)+\cdots\right].\tag{8.16}$$

All boundaries of the diagram end on the same ZZ-instanton boundary conditions labelled by (m, n) and (k, ±). We will focus our attention to the leading non-perturbative correction. Counting powers of the string coupling according to the Euler characteristic, only the disk and cylinder diagram contribute to this order in the exponential, while we also only keep the product of n once-punctured disk diagrams. Thus to leading order, the non-perturbative correction reads

exp + · · · . (8.17)

We will thus discuss the computation of the punctured disk diagram and the cylinder diagram in the following. The empty disk diagram can be obtained from the punctured disk diagram by resorting to the dilaton equation as in section 8.1.

The punctured disk. As in section 8.1, the punctured disk is given by the product of the wavefunctions,

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(m,n,k,\pm;P)=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\,\Psi^{(b)}_{(m,n)}(P)\,\widehat{\Psi}^{(ib)}_{(k,\pm)}(iP)\tag{8.18}$$ $$=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\,\frac{4\sinh(2\pi mbP)\sinh(2\pi nb^{-1}P)\sinh(2\pi kb^{\pm1}P)}{\sinh(2\pi bP)\sinh(2\pi b^{-1}P)\,P}\;.$$

The factor of 1 2 √ 2 comes from the normalization of the disk partition function as in (8.5), which we determined in (8.7) to be Ce D2N = 1 2 √ 2 . Thus there is no parameter left in this subsection to adjust.

Notice that this is a redundant basis of boundary conditions. We have for example

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(m,1,k,+;P)=\sum_{r^{\frac{2}{m}|m-k|+1}}^{m+k-1}Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(1,1,r,+;P).\tag{8.19}$$

Similar to [30], we take this as an indication that in the full string theory, these boundary conditions are actually BRST equivalent to each other. In particular, this motivates us to restrict to the (1, 1) ZZ boundary condition in the spacelike Liouville theory.24 For these,

<sup>24</sup>However it seems that not all boundary conditions parametrized by m, n, k, ± can be reduced to this case in a simple way, but only boundary conditions with m = n = 1 seem to be present in the matrix integral, at least at the level of single-instanton calculus considered in this paper. A similar result was observed in the analysis of multi-instanton effects in c = 1 string theory of [9]. There, only the class of ZZ-instantons of type (m, 1) gave a non-vanishing contribution to string S-matrix elements, as deduced by matching to the dual c = 1 matrix quantum mechanics.

we get the simpler answer

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(k,\pm;P)\equiv Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(1,1,k,\pm;P)=\frac{\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi kb^{\pm1}P)}{P}.\tag{8.20}$$

To obtain the empty disk diagram, we apply the dilaton equation as in (8.9) and obtain

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(k,\pm)=Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(k,\pm;P=\frac{iQ}{2})-Z^{(b)}_{\rm disk}(k,\pm;P=\frac{iQ}{2})\tag{8.21}$$ $$=2\sqrt{2}\left(\frac{\sin(\pi b^{\pm1}kQ)}{Q}-\frac{\sin(\pi b^{\pm1}k\tilde{Q})}{\tilde{Q}}\right)$$ $$=\frac{4\sqrt{2}\left(-1\right)^{k}b^{\pm1}\sin(\pi kb^{\pm2})}{1-b^{\pm4}}\.$$

The cylinder diagram. We can similarly compute the string cylinder diagram associated to the (k, ±) ZZ-instanton. We already computed the cylinder partition function of timelike Liouville theory with two (k, ±) boundaries on both sides in (3.37). Let us focus on the '+'-case, for which we have

$$Z^{(b)}_{\rm cyl}(k,+)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{{\rm d}t}{2}\,\eta(it)^{2}\chi^{(b)}_{(1,1)}(\frac{i}{t})\sum_{r\stackrel{{\geq}}{{=}}1}^{2k-1}\sum_{s\stackrel{{\geq}}{{=}}1}^{\infty}\chi^{(ib)}_{(r,s)}(\frac{i}{t})\tag{8.22}$$ $$=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{{\rm d}t}{2t}\,\eta(it)^{2}\chi^{(b)}_{(1,1)}(it)\sum_{r\stackrel{{\geq}}{{=}}1}^{2k-1}\sum_{s\stackrel{{\geq}}{{=}}1}^{\infty}\chi^{(ib)}_{(r,s)}(it)\,$$

where we mapped t → 1 t in the second line. The ingredients are similar to (8.11): the integral over t integrates over the width of the cylinder, η(it) 2 is the ghost partition function and the factor 1 2 originates from the Z2-symmetry that exchanges the two boundaries. The volume of the U(1) automorphism group of the cylinder is 1 in these conventions.

We will continue to work with the representation in the second line of (8.22). The integral is convergent in the region t → 0, which becomes obvious when writing it as

$$Z^{(b)}_{cyl}(k,+)\!=\!\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{{\rm d}t}{2t}\,(1-{\rm e}^{-2\pi t})\sum_{r\stackrel{{\lambda}}{{=}}1}^{2k-1}\sum_{s\stackrel{{\lambda}}{{=}}1}^{\infty}{\rm e}^{-\frac{\pi t}{2t}((r-1)b-(s+1)b^{-1})((r+1)b-(s-1)b^{-1})}(1-{\rm e}^{-2\pi rst})\,\tag{8.23}$$

since the infinite sum over s is absolutely convergent and the factor (1 − e −2πt) vanishes for t → 0. However, the integral is divergent in the region t → ∞ and this divergence is somewhat subtle. One can make sense of this integral using string field theory, as was explained in [60] for the case of the ordinary minimal string. Let us review the argument. Consider first a single term

$$\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{{\rm d}t}{2t}\,{\rm e}^{-\frac{\pi t}{2}((r-1)b-(s+1)b^{-1})((r+1)b-(s-1)b^{-1})}(1-{\rm e}^{-2\pi t})(1-{\rm e}^{-2\pi rest}).\tag{8.24}$$

Assuming that the integral is convergent, i.e.

$$((r-1)b-(s+1)b^{-1})((r+1)b-(s-1)b^{-1})>0\,\tag{8.25}$$

the integral over t converges and can be evaluated to

$$\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{{\rm d}t}{2t}\,{\rm e}^{-\frac{nt}{2}((r-1)b-(s+1)b^{-1})((r+1)b-(s-1)b^{-1})}(1-{\rm e}^{-2rt})(1-{\rm e}^{-2rt})$$ $$=\frac{1}{2}\log\left(\frac{((r-1)b\pm(s-1)b^{-1})((r+1)b\pm(s+1)b^{-1})}{((r-1)b\pm(s+1)b^{-1})((r+1)b\pm(s-1)b^{-1})}\right)\,\tag{8.26}$$

where we take the product over both choices of sign in the logarithm. Within string field theory, this formula is also taken to be valid when the argument of the exponential is positive. However, in that case the argument of the logarithm might be negative and hence the branch is ambiguous. Different branches correspond to different definitions of the integration contour in the string field space.

Assuming that b 2 ̸∈ Q, this deals with all cases (r, s) ̸= (1, 1), where the argument of the logarithm is non-singular. In the case (r, s) = (1, 1), we should compute the integral

$$\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{{\rm d}t}{2t}\left({\rm e}^{2\pi t}-2+{\rm e}^{-2\pi t}\right)\,,\tag{8.27}$$

which of course diverges badly and cannot be rendered finite by contour deformation. The origin of this divergence is a breakdown of the Siegel gauge-fixing condition. One can instead fix the gauge in a different way as explained by Sen [11]. We will not repeat the full string field theory analysis here, which may be found in [60], but use the result that it leads to the interpretation

$$\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{{\rm d}t}{2t}\left({\rm e}^{2\pi t}-2+{\rm e}^{-2\pi t}\right)=-\frac{1}{2}\log\left(\,-\,2^{5}\pi^{3}T_{k,+}^{(b)}\right)\,.\tag{8.28}$$

Here, (T (b) k,+ ) − 1 2 is the instanton action as computed by the empty disk diagram, T (b) k,+ = −Z (b) disk(k, +). Again, the choice of branch cut in the logarithm is ambiguous.

Putting together the ingredients, we hence find

$$Z_{\rm cyl}(k_{+})=-\frac{1}{2}\log\big{(}-2^{5}\pi^{3}T^{(b)}_{k_{+}}\big{)}\tag{8.29}$$ $$+\frac{1}{2}\log\left(\prod_{r,\frac{2}{(r,b)\pi}\atop r\in[k,1]}^{2k-1}\prod_{r,\frac{2}{(r,b)\pi}\atop r\in[k,1]}^{\infty}\frac{((r-1)b\pm(s-1)b^{-1})((r+1)b\pm(s+1)b^{-1})}{((r-1)b\pm(s+1)b^{-1})((r+1)b\pm(s-1)b^{-1})}\right)$$ $$=-\frac{1}{2}\log\big{(}-2^{5}\pi^{3}T^{(b)}_{k_{+}}(1-b^{4})k^{2}\big{)}\,$$

where we used that the infinite product telescopes.

The leading ZZ-instanton correction to the quantum volumes. It is now simple to compute the leading ZZ-instanton correction to the resummed quantum volumes (2.8). The leading ZZ-instanton correction takes the form

$$\mathsf{V}_{n}^{(b)}(S_{0};P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})_{k,\pm}^{[1]}=\exp\left(\mathrm{e}^{S_{0}}Z_{\mathrm{disk}}^{(b)}(k,\pm)+Z_{\mathrm{cyl}}^{(b)}(k,\pm)\right)\prod_{j=1}^{n}Z_{\mathrm{abs}}^{(b)}(k,\pm;P_{j})\tag{8.30}$$ $$=\frac{i\,\mathrm{e}^{-T_{\pm,\pm}^{(b)}}}{2^{\frac{1}{2}}\pi^{\frac{1}{2}}(T_{k,\pm}^{(b)})^{\frac{1}{2}}(1-b^{\pm4})^{\frac{1}{2}}k\prod_{j=1}^{n}\frac{\sqrt{2}\sinh(2\pi b^{\pm1}P_{j})}{P_{j}}\,$$

with

$$T^{(b)}_{k,\pm}=\frac{4\sqrt{2}\,{\rm e}^{S_{0}}b^{\pm1}(-1)^{k+1}\sin(\pi kb^{\pm2})}{1-b^{\pm4}}\,\tag{8.31}$$

which matches with the value computed in the matrix model (6.10). In both formulas, the sign is ambiguous. Overall, we hence precisely reproduce (6.12), giving strong evidence for the proposal even at the non-perturbative level.

# Part IV Discussion

## 9 Loose ends

Let us mention some further applications of our duality and some loose ends.

Positivity of the volumes. For b ∈ R, i.e. c ≥ 25 and Pj ∈ R, the quantum volumes are all positive, as is appropriate for "volumes". This is obvious from the worldsheet definition (2.7). Indeed, all the OPE data and conformal blocks are positive so that the integrand is positive. Hence also the volumes are positive.

In fact, something stronger is true. Writing the volumes as a Laurent polynomial in b 2 and a polynomial in the momenta Pj , all non-zero coefficients of the polynomial are positive. This follows directly recursively from the deformed Mirzakhani recursion (2.13). Indeed, all terms in the recursion come with a plus sign and all the coefficients in the basic integrals (5.37) are strictly positive. Together with the correctness of the statement for the initial conditions, the recursion proves this statement.

If we however leave the regime c ≥ 25, then positivity of the volumes no longer holds. For large enough genus, the asymptotic formula (6.20) implies that the quantum volumes V (b) g,0 have a zero near c = 25 and one can directly check that such a zero exists in explicit examples. For example, all the zeros of V (b) 12,0 lie in the interval c ∈ [1, 25], the maximal of which is c ≈ 24.0046.

Dilaton equation of timelike Liouville theory. The duality discussed in this paper has an interesting consequence purely within CFT. The path integral of timelike Liouville induced from the action (2.3b) suggests that the operator e2bχ is an exactly marginal operator, just like in spacelike Liouville theory. It should merely change the value of the cosmological constant µtL. From KPZ scaling [136], µtL appears in correlation functions of both types of Liouville theory as a universal prefactor raised to the Euler characteristic. The marginal operator becomes Vb hˆ=1 in the quantum theory, where by a slight abuse of notation we label the operator by its conformal weight rather than its Liouville momentum. Hence the path integral formulation of the theory suggests that

$$\int{\rm d}^{2}z\,\left\langle\widehat{V}_{\hat{h}=1}(z)\prod_{j=1}^{n}\widehat{V}_{\hat{P}_{j}}(z_{j})\right\rangle_{g}\stackrel{{?}}{{\propto}}(2g-2+n)\left\langle\prod_{j=1}^{n}\widehat{V}_{\hat{P}_{j}}(z_{j})\right\rangle_{g}\,.\tag{9.1}$$

However, this equation turns out to need refinement. The problem is that the field Vb hˆ=1(z) has singular correlation functions because the structure constant of timelike Liouville theory has a simple pole at hˆ = 1 (i.e. Pb = 1 2 (b + b −1 )). We can define a residue field Reshˆ=1 Vb hˆ (z) whose correlation functions are given by the residue of the timelike Liouville correlation functions at hˆ = 1. However, the field Reshˆ=1 Vb hˆ (z) has special properties. It satisfies

$$\begin{array}{l}{{\rm Res}\,\widehat{V}_{\hat{h}}(z)=-\frac{1}{2}\partial\bar{\partial}\widehat{V}_{\hat{h}=0}(z)\.}\end{array}\tag{9.2}$$

Here, the field appearing on the right-hand-side is the unique primary field of conformal dimension 0 in the spectrum of timelike Liouville theory. As was discussed in the literature [56], and summarized in section 3.1, this field is however not the identity operator and in particular its derivative does not vanish. (9.2) is the analogue of the first higher equation of motion of spacelike Liouville theory [137]. It can easily be checked at the level of the three-point functions, which then ensures that (9.2) holds in any correlation function by conformal symmetry. In particular (9.2) implies that

$$\int{\rm d}^{2}z\,\left\langle\,{\rm Res}\,\widehat{V}_{h}(z)\prod_{j=1}^{n}\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{j}}(z_{j})\right\rangle_{g}=0\,\,,\tag{9.3}$$

instead of (9.1).

However, one can derive the correct version of the dilaton equation in timelike Liouville theory from the dilaton equation of the quantum volumes (4.15a). Since it holds for arbitrary operator insertions on the worldsheet, we can remove most of the integrals on the worldsheet in (4.15a) and get an equation where we only integrate over the location of the (n + 1)-st marked point on the LHS. We set for simplicity n = 0, since the other vertex operators are only spectators. We denote the partition functions by an empty correlation function ⟨1⟩g and ⟨b1⟩g, respectively. We get

(2g − 2)⟨1⟩g⟨b1⟩g = lim h→1 Z d 2 z ⟨Vh(z)⟩g⟨Vb1−h(z)⟩g − lim h→0 Z d 2 z ⟨Vh(z)⟩g⟨Vb1−h(z)⟩g = Z d 2 z ⟨V1(z)⟩g⟨Vb0(z)⟩g − lim h→0 − 1 h Z d 2 z ⟨1⟩g Res hˆ=1 Vb hˆ (z) g − Z d 2 z ⟨V ′ 0 (z)⟩g Res hˆ=1 Vb hˆ (z) + Z d 2 z ⟨1⟩g Vbren 1 (z) g = 1 2 Z d 2 z ⟨∂ ¯∂V ′ 0 (z) − 1 4R⟩g⟨Vb0(z)⟩g − ⟨V ′ 0 (z)⟩g⟨∂ ¯∂Vb0(z)⟩g − ⟨1⟩g Z d 2 z Vbren 1 (z) g = −⟨1⟩g Z d 2 z Vbren 1 (z) + 1 8RVb0(z) g . (9.4)

In going from the first to the second line, we Laurent expanded the second term. Here we used the notation

$$\widehat{V}_{1}^{\rm ren}(z)\equiv\lim_{\hat{h}\to1}\left[\widehat{V}_{\hat{h}}(z)-\frac{1}{\hat{h}-1}\mathop{\rm Res}_{\hat{h}=1}\widehat{V}_{\hat{h}}(z)\right]\,.\tag{9.5}$$

We also used the first higher equation of motion of ordinary Liouville theory,

$$V_{1}(z)=\frac{1}{2}\partial\bar{\partial}V^{\prime}_{0}-\frac{1}{8}{\cal R}\,\tag{9.6}$$

where ′ denotes a derivative in the conformal weight and R is the Ricci curvature. The combination

$$\Phi(z)=-\widehat{V}_{1}^{\rm ren}(z)-\frac{1}{8}{\cal R}\widehat{V}_{0}(z)\tag{9.7}$$

does indeed transform like a primary field of conformal weight 1, up to an inhomogeneous term that is a total derivative. We used integration by parts to cancel the two terms in the fourth line of (9.4). We thus learn that

$$\int{\rm d}^{2}z\,\left\langle\Phi(z)\prod_{j=1}^{n}\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{j}}(z_{j})\right\rangle_{g}=(2g-2+n)\left\langle\prod_{j=1}^{n}\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{j}}(z_{j})\right\rangle_{g}\,,\tag{9.8}$$

which is the correct version of (9.1). We did not manage to prove this equation directly in conformal field theory, but it is an interesting prediction of the present duality.

Defect regime. In the worldsheet description of the Virasoro minimal string (section 7), we took physical vertex operators to have Pj ∈ R, i.e. the external spacelike Liouville momentum was real and the timelike Liouville momentum was imaginary. This can of course be relaxed and we can consider general complex momenta Pj , which should still give rise to the quantum volumes V (b) g,n(P1, . . . , Pn), but with complex values of the Liouville momenta. Let us reiterate however that the worldsheet moduli integrand can change non-smoothly when the external momenta Pj are complexified. In particular, whenever there is a pair of momenta Pj , Pk such that |Im(Pj ± Pk)| > Q 2 , the spacelike Liouville CFT correlator may pick up additional contributions from sub-threshold states in particular OPE channels. These contributions can affect the convergence of the moduli integral and may require regularization. In these situations the string diagrams are presumably not simply the analytic continuation of the corresponding quantum volumes.

Given the relation of the Virasoro minimal string and JT gravity, one may expect that taking Pj imaginary is related to the Weil-Petersson volumes of surfaces with conical defects as studied in [39, 50, 52, 54, 138]. Indeed, at least for sufficiently "sharp" defects, the corresponding Weil-Petersson volumes are simply obtained from the ordinary Weil-Petersson volumes by inserting purely imaginary values of the geodesic lengths. However, there is a subtlety. This prescription is only correct when the defects are sufficiently sharp; for blunter defects the Weil-Petersson volume changes in a non-analytic way. This mirrors the situation on the worldsheet described in the previous paragraph.

Witten's deformations of JT gravity. Witten proposed a duality between a large class of dilaton gravities and Hermitian matrix models [50]. The dilaton potentials in that duality are of the form

$$W(\Phi)=2\Phi+2\sum_{i=1}^{r}\varepsilon_{i}\,{\rm e}^{-\alpha_{i}\Phi}\tag{9.9}$$

with π < αi < 2π. For P i εi = 0, this class of dilaton gravities is described by a dual matrix model with leading density of states

$$\varrho_{0}(E)=\frac{{\rm e}^{2\pi\sqrt{E}}W(\sqrt{E})+{\rm e}^{-2\pi\sqrt{E}}W(-\sqrt{E})}{8\pi\sqrt{E}}.\tag{9.10}$$

This formula is derived by deforming JT gravity by a gas of defects. Let us emphasize that the potential of the Virasoro minimal string is not of this form. Nevertheless, when plugging the sinh-dilaton potential given in eq. (2.1) into (9.9), one recovers the correct density of states of the Virasoro matrix integral (up to a rescaling of the energy). This gives some evidence that the equations of [50] hold beyond the assumptions stated above.

Tau-scaling limit and cancellations in the quantum volumes. Some interesting recent works [139–141] have investigated the perturbative sum over higher-genus contributions to the spectral form factor

$${\rm SFF}(T)=\sum_{g=0}^{\infty}{\rm e}^{-2gS_{0}}\,{\rm SFF}_{g}(T)=\sum_{g=0}^{\infty}{\rm e}^{-2gS_{0}}Z_{g,n=2}(\beta+iT,\beta-iT)\tag{9.11}$$

of double-scaled matrix models and dilaton gravity models in the so-called "tau-scaling" limit, which is a late-time T → ∞ limit with T e −S0 fixed. The linear growth of SFFg=0(T) at late times (the "ramp") is a universal feature of double-scaled matrix integrals, but these works argued that in the tau-scaling limit the full sum over genera in fact has a finite radius of convergence, providing perturbative access to the late time plateau of the spectral form factor. A key to this convergence is the fact that the genus-g contribution to the spectral form factor only grows as ∼ T 2g+1 at late times, rather than the expected T 3g−1 . This slower growth is facilitated by novel cancellations due to the underlying integrable structure of the theory; in JT gravity these correspond to cancellations in the series expansion of the Weil-Petersson volumes in terms of the two geodesic lengths. In Virasoro minimal string theory, the quantum volumes V (b) g,2 exhibit the exact same cancellations. Adapting the notation of [139] for the Weil-Petersson volumes, if one expands the quantum volumes as

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{g,2}(P_{1},P_{2})=\sum_{d_{1},d_{2}=0}^{d_{1}+d_{2}=3g-1}\frac{(4\pi^{2})^{d_{1}}(4\pi^{2})^{d_{2}}}{d_{1}!d_{2}!}{\sf v}^{(b)}_{g,d_{1},d_{2}}P_{1}^{2d_{1}}P_{2}^{2d_{2}}\,\tag{9.12}$$

with some coefficients v (b) g,d1,d2 , then the genus-g contribution to the spectral form factor is given by gluing trumpets as in (2.18)

$$Z_{g,n=2}(\beta_{1},\beta_{2})=\sum_{d_{1},d_{2}=0}^{d_{1}+d_{2}=3g-1}\frac{\nu_{g,d_{1},d_{2}}^{(b)}}{8\pi^{3}}\,\beta_{1}^{d_{1}+\frac{1}{2}}\,\beta_{2}^{d_{2}+\frac{1}{2}}\,\tag{9.13}$$

upon analytic continuation to β1 = β + iT, β2 = β − iT. One can indeed verify that25

X 2q d=0 (−1)d v (b) g,d,2q−d = 0, q > g , (9.14)

leading to the expected slower late-time growth of the genus-g contribution to the spectral form factor, SFFg(T) ∼ T 2g+1 .

Near-extremal black holes. Dilaton gravity is often introduced as a universal 2d theory of gravity that describes the physics of near-extremal black holes in higher dimensions. In fact this approach was used recently to successfully compute supersymmetric indices from the gravitational path integral [142–147]. In particular one can engineer also sinh-dilaton gravity from near-extremal limits of higher dimensional black holes.

From the definition, one setup is particularly straightforward. Consider an AdS3/CFT2 correspondence whose dual CFT is assumed to be irrational and with only Virasoro symmetry (as well as a discrete spectrum).26 Then its torus partition function can be written as

$$Z_{\rm CFT}(\tau,\bar{\tau})=\chi_{\rm vac}(\tau)\chi_{\rm vac}(-\bar{\tau})+\sum_{h,\bar{h}>0}a_{h,\bar{h}}\chi_{h}(\tau)\chi_{\bar{h}}(-\bar{\tau})\,\tag{9.15}$$

where ah,h¯ are positive integer degeneracies. One can take the CFT to be Lorentzian which amounts to making τ and ¯τ purely imaginary and independent, i.e. τ = iβ and −τ¯ = iβ¯. One can thus consider the limit β¯ → ∞ with β held fixed. This reduces the CFT partition function to the vacuum character, which is the disk partition function of the Virasoro minimal

<sup>25</sup>We have checked this explicitly up to g = 10.

<sup>26</sup>Below we actually make the slightly stronger assumption that there is a nonzero gap in the spectrum of twists of non-vacuum Virasoro primaries.

string. In the bulk, such a limit corresponds to a near-extremal limit of the BTZ black hole.27 In particular, we learn that the Virasoro minimal string sits inside any irrational AdS3/CFT2 correspondence as a universal subsector.

Relation to ensemble duality of 3d gravity. The previous paragraph has in particular very concrete ramifications for the holographic dual of pure 3d gravity. It has been conjectured that 3d quantum gravity admits a holographic description in terms of an appropriate notion of an "ensemble of 2d CFTs" or "random 2d CFT" [151], and indeed many aspects of 3d gravity, particularly Euclidean wormhole partition functions, are nontrivially reproduced by statistical averages over 2d CFT data [152, 153]. The precise nature of such an ensemble description remains elusive (but see [154] for recent progress), and many Euclidean wormhole partition functions may instead be interpreted in terms of coarse-graining microscopic data of individual CFTs [155–157]. The Virasoro minimal string now leads to the concrete prediction that the near-extremal limit as defined in the previous paragraph of the random ensemble of 2d CFTs is governed by the Virasoro matrix integral. This in particular lends further credence to the idea that 3d gravity is described holographically via a suitable ensemble of 2d CFTs.

## 10 Future directions

Supersymmetric Virasoro minimal string. A natural extension of the Virasoro minimal string would be to incorporate worldsheet supersymmetry. For N = 1 supersymmetry, spacelike Liouville theory is a unitary superconformal field theory with central charge c ≥ 27 2 . Whereas the structure constants of N = 1 spacelike Liouville theory have been bootstrapped (see e.g. [158–160]), the N = 1 timelike counterpart with ˆc ≤ 3 2 has not been discussed much in the literature (see however [49, 161] for a discussion of supersymmetric timelike Liouville theory from a path integral perspective). The spectrum and structure constants of supersymmetric timelike Liouville theory have not been explored. It would be interesting to understand whether a relation similar to (3.6) exists also in the supersymmetric case.

We expect that the N = 1 supersymmetric Virasoro minimal string, defined as the worldsheet superconformal field theory

$$c\geq\frac{27}{2}\ {\cal N}=1\quad\oplus\quad\hat{c}\leq\frac{3}{2}\ {\cal N}=1\quad\oplus\ {\sf b}{\sf c}\mbox{-ghosts}\ \oplus\ \beta\gamma\mbox{-ghosts}\,\tag{10.1}$$

Liouville CFT $\quad$ Liouville CFT $\quad$

<sup>27</sup>Usually, one considers a combined semiclassical and near-extremal limit in which β¯ ∼ c → ∞ combined with the further limit β ≲ c −1 , where the model reduces to the Schwarzian or JT gravity in the bulk [51,148]. At large c, the validity of this approximation requires a further sparseness assumption on the spectrum of the theory [149, 150].

also admits a dual matrix model description. As explained in [109] for the case of super JT gravity without time reversal symmetry, there are two such theories. On the bulk side, they differ whether we weigh odd spin structures with an opposite sign with respect to even spin structures or not, corresponding to type 0A and 0B GSO projections of (10.1). The former corresponds to a matrix model with odd N and the latter to a matrix model with even N. Both cases can be reduced to a GUE ensemble for the supercharge, see [109, eqs. (2.19) and (2.20)]. For the super Virasoro minimal string, it is natural to conjecture that the leading density of states of the dual matrix integral is given by the following universal density of states in N = 1 SCFT:28

$$\rho_{0}^{(b)}(P)=2\sqrt{2}\cosh(\pi bP)\cosh(\pi b^{-1}P)\,\tag{10.2}$$

with the parametrization

$$c=\frac{3}{2}+3Q^{2}\,\ \ Q=b+b^{-1}\,\ \ h_{P}=\frac{c-\frac{3}{2}}{24}+\frac{P^{2}}{2}+\frac{\delta}{16}\tag{10.3}$$

where δ = 0 in the NS-sector and δ = 1 in the R-sector, and P 2 is again identified with the energy of eigenvalues in the matrix integral. In the limit b → 0, this reduces to the density of states of super JT gravity found by Stanford and Witten [109].

One can also consider N = 2 supersymmetry. N = 2 JT gravity was recently analyzed [162] and one can imagine coupling N = 2 spacelike and timelike Liouville together which define a critical N = 2 superstring. N = 2 supersymmetric Liouville theory stands on less firm footing. For c > 3 spacelike Liouville is a unitary superconformal field theory, with its timelike counterpart restricted to the regime c < 3. The spectrum and structure constants for neither theory have been established. However, at least the spacelike structure constants are conjecturally known via the duality to the supersymmetric SL(2, R)/U(1) Kazama–Suzuki supercoset model [163].

Different matrix model statistics. There are three classes of bosonic matrix models, the GUE, GOE or GSE type. In this paper, we discussed Hermitian matrix integrals, which correspond to GUE. In the bulk, this corresponds to only summing over orientable surfaces. It is also possible to consider the other two matrix model statistics, which also involve summing over non-orientable surfaces in the bulk, possibly with a phase (−1)χ(Σ), where χ(Σ) is the Euler characteristic of the surface. This was explored for JT gravity in [109]. Similarly, one can consider the different Altland-Zirnbauer classes of supersymmetric matrix models [164] which are expected to be dual to the different varieties of the supersymmetric Virasoro minimal string.

<sup>28</sup>SC is grateful to Henry Maxfield for discussions explaining this formula.

Two spacelike Liouville theories. In the Virasoro minimal string we combine spacelike Liouville with central charge c ≥ 25 and timelike Liouville theory with central charge 26 −c. Another natural 'minimal string' worldsheet is two coupled spacelike Liouville theories with central charges c+ and c− such that c+ +c− = 26. In particular one can consider any complex central charge c± ∈ C\(−∞, 1]∪[25,∞). This model seems to be more complicated than the Virasoro minimal string because for example the product of two DOZZ structure constants does not cancel out. Thus already the three-point function is non-trivial. The product of two DOZZ structure constants has in fact an elliptic structure with modular parameter τ = b 2 ∈ H [43].

In the special case c± ∈ 13 ± iR, one may suspect a relation to dS3 quantum gravity, which is described by purely imaginary central charge (up to order O(1) corrections) and thus this worldsheet theory seems to be more suitable to describe two-dimensional quantum gravity with a positive cosmological constant.

Non-analytic Virasoro minimal string. There is another variant of the Virasoro minimal string that we might call the non-analytic Virasoro minimal string. To define it, we have to specialize to the rational case b 2 = q p ∈ Q. Then there exists a distinct theory from timelike Liouville theory that we can consider as a matter theory. Its structure constants for real external Pbj are given by [78, 165, 166]

$$\widehat{C}_{\hat{b}}^{\rm non-ana}(\widehat{P}_{1},\widehat{P}_{2},\widehat{P}_{3})=\widehat{C}_{\hat{b}}(\widehat{P}_{1},\widehat{P}_{2},\widehat{P}_{3})\sigma(\widehat{P}_{1},\widehat{P}_{2},\widehat{P}_{3})\,\tag{10.4}$$

where

$$\sigma(\widehat{P}_{1},\widehat{P}_{2},\widehat{P}_{3})=\begin{cases}1\;,&\prod_{\pm,\pm}\sin\pi\big{(}\frac{1}{2}(p-q)+\sqrt{pq}(\widehat{P}_{1}\pm\widehat{P}_{2}\pm\widehat{P}_{3})\big{)}<0\;,\\ 0\;,&\text{else}\;,\end{cases}\tag{10.5}$$

and Cbˆb are the timelike Liouville structure constants discussed in section 3.1. This matter theory is called non-analytic Liouville theory, while for the special case ˆc = 1, it is known as the Runkel-Watts theory. The non-analytic quantum volumes defined by this matter theory are presumably closely related to the quantum volumes V (b) g,n(P1, . . . , Pn). However, since it is not obvious how to extend the structure constants (10.4) to complex values of Pbj , the definition is at least naively restricted to the defect regime with Pj ∈ iR.

Multi-instanton effects and gs-sub-leading contributions. Another interesting direction for future research is to study non-perturbative multi-instanton effects [9, 167, 168]. A general worldsheet instanton configuration with a number of instantons of type (ki , ±i) in the timelike Liouville sector is expected to correspond to the non-perturbative contribution to the Virasoro matrix integral. They stem from a configuration with multiple eigenvalues integrated along the steepest descent contour of the extrema at E ∗ ki,±i . This was recently considered for the minimal string [168]. Furthermore, it would be interesting to study subleading corrections in gs at a given instanton configuration coming from worldsheet diagrams at higher open string loop level, as depicted in (8.16), which would require a more systematic string field theory analysis [14, 20, 169].

Off-shell topologies in 3d gravity. The Virasoro minimal string is presumably also useful to compute certain off-shell partition functions of 3d quantum gravity. While onshell partition functions are by now fully understood [88], it has been argued that especially Seifert manifolds play an important role in the holography of 3d gravity. In particular, it was argued in [51] that they give off-shell contributions to the 3d gravity partition function that save the negativities in the Maloney-Witten partition function [93,170,171] by summing up to a non-perturbative shift of the extremality bound for BTZ black holes. The negativities precisely appear in the near-extremal limit described above and thus the tool to argue for their resolution involved the reduction to JT gravity. The 3d gravity partition function on Seifert manifolds was argued to be related to the JT gravity partition function on a Riemann surface with additional insertions of conical defects at the singular points of the Seifert fibration. The Virasoro minimal string should lead to a precise refinement of this argument and thus it would be interesting to reconsider it in this new light.

Direct derivation of the deformed Mirzakhani recursion. We derived the deformation of Mirzakhani's recursion given by eq. (2.13) in a rather convoluted way by first finding the dual matrix model and then translating its loop equations to the deformed Mirzakhani recursion in the bulk. It would be more satisfying to give a direct derivation of the recursion relation from the worldsheet, much like Mirzakhani managed to use a generalization of McShane's identity [172] to give a direct derivation of the recursion relation [61]. For the minimal string, such a derivation is in principle available, thanks to the existence of higher equations of motions in Liouville theory [137, 173], even though it was so far only applied to low g and n [53, 173–175]. Higher equations of motion do not seem to help for the Virasoro minimal string since the relevant vertex operators are not degenerate. However, it is possible that techniques known from topological string theory can lead to such a direct derivation [176].

Cohomological interpretation of the minimal string. We found a very satisfying realization of the Virasoro minimal string in terms of intersection theory on Mg,n, see eq. (4.12). Such a clear interpretation is to our knowledge not available for the usual minimal string and it would be interesting to find one, thus potentially leading to a more direct understanding of the duality in that case.

# Part V Appendices

## A ψ- and κ-classes

In this appendix, we briefly review the definition of the cohomology ψi- and κm-classes that enter the intersection number formula for the volumes (4.14). We refer e.g. to [177] for more details.

We always consider the cohomology with complex coefficients and will not indicate this always explicitly. One can construct n line bundles L1, . . . ,Ln over Mg,n whose fiber at Σg,n is the cotangent space at the i-th marked point on the surface.29 One can then take the first Chern class of these bundles and obtain the ψ-classes

$\psi_{i}=c_{1}(\mathbb{L}_{i})$.

Topological gravity computes the intersection number of ψ-classes [63]:

$$\int_{\overline{\cal M}_{g,n}}\psi^{d_{1}}_{1}\cdots\psi^{d_{n}}_{n}\,\qquad d_{1}+\cdots+d_{n}=3g-3+n\.$$ (A.2)

For our purposes we also need the so-called κ-classes. Let π : Mg,n+1 −→ Mg,n be the forgetful map that forgets the location of the last marked point. The fiber of this map describes the location of the (n+1)-st marked point and is hence isomorphic to the Riemann surface itself. One can then take a cohomology class in Mg,n+1 and consider the pushforward to Mg,n, which means that we integrate it over the fiber of the map. For α a k-form we have

$$\pi_{*}\alpha=\int_{\Sigma_{g,n}}\alpha\in{\rm H}^{k-2}(\overline{{\cal M}}_{g,n})\.$$ (A.3)

We can then define the Mumford-Morita-Miller classes κm as follows:

$\kappa_{m}=\pi_{*}(\psi^{m+1}_{n+1})$.

Notice that κm is a class in H2m(Mg,n). In fact, all cohomology classes we consider are even cohomology classes and thus commute.

<sup>29</sup>The definition of the line bundle on the boundary of moduli space is a bit subtle and we again refer e.g. to [177] for details.

In particular, κ1 plays a very important role. It is a class in H2 (Mg,n) and is known to represent the cohomology class of the Weil-Petersson form on a surface with cusps [178,179]:

$$\kappa_{1}=\frac{1}{2\pi^{2}}\left[\omega_{\rm WP}(0,\ldots,0)\right]\,.$$ (A.5)

Here, it is important that we consider the Weil-Petersson form on a surface where all the punctures are represented by cusps in the hyperbolic language. If we have a surface with geodesic boundaries, the class of the Weil-Petersson form is instead modified to [96]

$$\omega_{\rm WP}(\ell_{1},\ldots,\ell_{n})]=2\pi^{2}\kappa_{1}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}\ell_{i}^{2}\psi_{i}\.$$ (A.6)

## B List of quantum volumes

Let us present a list of the quantum volumes V (b) g,n as computed by the topological recursion. We borrow the following notation from [180]

$m_{(\ell_{1},...,\ell_{k})}=P_{1}^{2\ell_{1}}P_{2}^{2\ell_{2}}\cdots P_{k}^{2\ell_{k}}+\ \mbox{permutations}\,$ (B.1)

where we sum over all distinct permutations of (ℓ1, ℓ2, . . . , ℓk, 0, . . . , 0) (with n−k additional zeros). For example,

$$m_{(1)}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}P_{j}^{2}\,$$ (B.2a)

$$m_{(1,1)}=\sum_{1\leq j<k\leq n}P_{j}^{2}P_{k}^{2}\ ,$$ (B.2b)

$$m_{(2,1)}=\sum_{j\neq k}^{n}P_{j}^{4}P_{k}^{2}\.$$ (B.2c)

We then have

$${\sf V}_{0,4}^{(b)}=\frac{c-13}{24}+m_{(1)}\,$$ (B.3a)

$${\sf V}_{1,1}^{(0)}=\frac{c-13}{576}+\frac{m_{(1)}}{24}\,$$ (B.3b)

$${\sf V}^{(b)}_{0.5}=\frac{5c^{2}-130c+797}{1152}+\frac{c-13}{8}\,m_{(1)}+\frac{m_{(2)}}{2}+2m_{(1,1)}\,$$ (B.3c)

## C Liouville CFT compendium

In this appendix we specify the conventions we follow for the three-point coefficients in c ≤ 1 and c ≥ 25 Liouville CFT and list some of their properties, as well as present a brief review of the recursion relations that we employ to compute the sphere four-point and torus one-point Virasoro conformal blocks numerically.

### C.1 Liouville CFT structure constants

In our convention the structure constant for spacelike Liouville theory is given by (3.1)

$$\langle V_{P_{1}}(0)V_{P_{2}}(1)V_{P_{3}}(\infty)\rangle=C_{b}(P_{1},P_{2},P_{3})\equiv\frac{\Gamma_{b}(2Q)\Gamma_{b}(\frac{Q}{2}\pm iP_{1}\pm iP_{2}\pm iP_{3})}{\sqrt{2}\Gamma_{b}(Q)^{3}\prod_{k=1}^{3}\Gamma_{b}(Q\pm2iP_{k})}\,$$ (C.1)

while the timelike structure constant (3.6) is given by

$$\langle\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{1}}(0)\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{2}}(1)\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{3}}(\infty)\rangle=\widehat{C}_{\hat{k}}(\widehat{P}_{1},\widehat{P}_{2},\widehat{P}_{3})=\frac{\sqrt{2}\Gamma_{\hat{b}}(\hat{b}+\hat{b}^{-1})^{3}\prod_{\hat{k}=1}^{3}\Gamma_{\hat{b}}(\hat{b}+\hat{b}^{-1}\pm2\widehat{P}_{\hat{k}})}{\Gamma_{\hat{b}}(2\hat{b}+2\hat{b}^{-1})\,\Gamma_{\hat{b}}(\frac{b\hat{b}^{k-1}}{2}\pm\widehat{P}_{1}\pm\widehat{P}_{2}\pm\widehat{P}_{3})}\;.$$ (C.2)

Cb(P1, P2, P3) is invariant under reflections Pi → −Pi and under permutations of P1, P2, P3. The same with hatted variables holds true for Cbˆb (Pb1, Pb2, Pb3).

The double Gamma function is a meromorphic function that can be defined as the unique function satisfying the functional equations

$$\Gamma_{b}(z+b)=\frac{\sqrt{2\pi}\,b^{bz-\frac{1}{2}}}{\Gamma(bz)}\,\Gamma_{b}(z)\,\qquad\Gamma_{b}(z+b^{-1})=\frac{\sqrt{2\pi}\,b^{-b^{-1}z+\frac{1}{2}}}{\Gamma(b^{-1}z)}\,\Gamma_{b}(z)\,$$ (C.3)

together with the normalization Γb( Q 2 ) = 1. It admits an explicit integral representation in the half-plane Re(z) > 0.

$$\log\Gamma_{b}(z)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{{\rm d}t}{t}\left(\frac{{\rm e}^{\frac{t}{2}(Q-2z)}-1}{4\sinh(\frac{t}{2})\sinh(\frac{t}{2t})}-\frac{1}{8}\left(Q-2z\right)^{2}{\rm e}^{-t}-\frac{Q-2z}{2t}\right)\.$$ (C.4)

Γb(z) has simple poles for

$z=-(r-1)b-(s-1)b^{-1}$, $r$, $s\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq1}$, (C.5)

and consequently Cb(P1, P2, P3) has

- zeros when Pk = ± i 2 (rb + sb−1 ) , r, s ∈ Z≥1 , k ∈ {1, 2, 3}
- poles when ±P1 ± P2 ± P3 = i(r − 1 2 )b + i(s − 1 2 )b −1 , r, s ∈ Z≥1 .

The zeros are associated to the case where one of the external operators corresponds to a degenerate representation of the Virasoro algebra. On the other hand, the poles are associated with multi-twist operators in non-rational two-dimensional conformal field theory [181,182]. These poles may cross the contour of integration in the OPE of the spacelike Liouville correlator (3.5) when there exists a pair of external operators with |Im(Pi ± Pj )| > Q 2 , leading to additional discrete contributions to the conformal block decomposition. Similarly we find that the timelike structure constant Cbˆb (Pb1, Pb2, Pb3) has

- zeros when ±Pb1 ± Pb2 ± Pb3 = (r − 1 2 ) ˆb + i(s − 1 2 ) ˆb −1 , r, s ∈ Z≥1 .
- poles when Pbk = ± 1 2 (r ˆb + s ˆb −1 ) , r, s ∈ Z≥1 , k ∈ {1, 2, 3} .

Let us note the identity (see [183] for the case m = 2, n = 1)

$$\Gamma_{b}(z)=\lambda_{m,n,b}\,(mn)^{\frac{1}{2}z(Q-z)}\prod_{k=0}^{m-1}\prod_{l=0}^{n-1}\Gamma_{\frac{b\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{n}}}\left(\frac{z+kb+lb^{-1}}{\sqrt{mn}}\right)\.$$ (C.6)

for m, n ∈ Z≥1. Here, λm,n,b is some irrelevant constant that will cancel out of every formula we ever need, since we always have equally many Γb's in the numerator and denominator.

To prove this identity, one merely need to check that the LHS satisfies the expected functional equation (C.3). Most factors on the RHS telescope and the remaining factors combine into a single Gamma-function with the help of the multiplication formula of the Gamma function, which gives the expected result. Given that

$$\Gamma_{1}(z)=\frac{(2\pi)^{\frac{z}{2}}}{G(z)}\,$$ (C.7)

we hence have the following formula for Γ√ m n (z) in terms of G(z):

$$\Gamma_{\sqrt{\frac{m}{n}}}(z)=\lambda_{m,n}(mn)^{\frac{1}{2}i(\frac{\pi mn}{\sqrt{mn}}-i)}\prod_{k=0}^{m-1}\prod_{l=0}^{n-1}\Gamma_{1}\left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{mn}}+\frac{k}{m}+\frac{l}{n}\right)$$ $$=\lambda_{m,n}(2\pi)^{\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{mn}*}(mn)^{\frac{1}{2}i(\frac{\pi mn}{\sqrt{mn}}-i)}\prod_{k=0}^{m-1}\prod_{l=0}^{n-1}G\left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{mn}}+\frac{k}{m}+\frac{l}{n}\right)^{-1}\.$$ (C.8)

This formula is numerically useful when computing the double Gamma function on rational values of b 2 , since the Barnes G function has efficient numerical implementations.

### C.2 Zamolodchikov recursion for conformal blocks

Let us now review the explicit recursion relations that we use to efficiently compute the sphere four-point and the torus one-point Virasoro conformal blocks, originally derived in [124] and in [121, 122], respectively.

We parametrize the central charge of the Virasoro algebra as c = 1+6Q2 with Q = b+b −1 , and the holomorphic Virasoro weights of external primaries as hPi = Q2 4 +P 2 i . We also define

$$P_{r,s}=i\,\frac{rb+sb^{-1}}{2}\,\qquad A_{r,s}=\frac{1}{2}\prod_{\begin{subarray}{c}p=1-r\\ (p,q)\neq(0,0),(r,s)\end{subarray}}^{r}\prod_{\begin{subarray}{c}s\\ p\bar{b}+q\bar{b}^{-1}\end{subarray}}^{s}\frac{1}{pb+qb^{-1}}\.$$ (C.9)

The sphere four-point elliptic conformal block H (b) 0,4 (P4, P3, P2, P1; P|q) introduced in (7.19) admits a power series expansion in the elliptic nome q(z), defined in (7.20), and satisfies the following recursion relation,

$${\cal H}^{(b)}_{0,4}(P_{i};P|q)=1+\sum_{r,s\geq1}(16q)^{rs}\frac{A_{rs}B_{rs}(P_{1},P_{2})B_{rs}(P_{4},P_{3})}{P^{2}-P_{rs}^{2}}\,{\cal H}^{(b)}_{0,4}(P_{i};P\to(P_{rs}^{2}+rs)^{\frac{1}{2}}|q)\,$$ (C.10)

where the "fusion polynomials" Br,s are given by

$$B_{r,s}(P_{1},P_{2})=\prod_{p\stackrel{{2}}{{=}}1-r\stackrel{{q}}{{=}}1-s}^{r-1}\frac{2iP_{1}\pm2iP_{2}+pb+qb^{-1}}{2}\,$$ (C.11)

and we take the product over both sign choices.

Similarly, the torus one-point elliptic conformal block H (b) 1,1 (P1; P|q) introduced in (7.3) admits a power series expansion in q = e2πiτ and obeys the recursion relation,

$${\cal H}^{(b)}_{1,1}(P_{1};P|q)=1+\sum_{r,s\geq1}q^{rs}\frac{A_{rs}B_{rs}(P_{1},(P^{2}_{rs}+rs)^{\frac{1}{2}})B_{rs}(P_{1},P_{r,s})}{P^{2}-P^{2}_{r,s}}\\ \times{\cal H}^{(b)}_{1,1}(P_{1};P\to(P^{2}_{r,s}+rs)^{\frac{1}{2}}|q)\.$$ (C.12)

In this case, the product of the fusion polynomials may be written as

$$B_{r,s}(P_{1},(P_{r,s}^{2}+rs)^{\frac{1}{2}})B_{r,s}(P_{1},P_{r,s})=\prod_{p^{\frac{2}{2}1}}^{2r-1}\prod_{q^{\frac{2}{2}1}}^{2s-1}\frac{2iP_{1}\pm pb\pm qb^{-1}}{2}\,$$ (C.13)

where we take the product over all four sign choices.

The Liouville CFT sphere four-point functions decomposed into conformal blocks are

G(1234|z) ≡ VP1 (0)VP2 (z, z)VP3 (1)VP4 (∞) g=0 = Z ∞ 0 dP ρ(b) 0 (P)Cb(P1, P2, P)Cb(P3, P4, P) × F(b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4; P|z)F (b) 0,4 (P1, P2, P3, P4; P|z) , (C.14a) Gb(1234|z) ≡ Vb Pb1 (0)Vb Pb2 (z, z)Vb Pb3 (1)Vb Pb4 (∞) g=0 = Z C dPb (iPb) 2 2ρ (ˆb) 0 (iPb) Cbˆb (Pb1, Pb2, Pb)Cbˆb (Pb3, Pb4, Pb) × F(iˆb) 0,4 (Pb1, Pb2, Pb3, Pb4; Pb|z)F (iˆb) 0,4 (Pb1, Pb2, Pb3, Pb4; Pb|z) . (C.14b)

The four-point crossing symmetry relations take the form,

$G(1234|z)=G(3214|1-z)$, (C.15a)

$\widehat{G}(1234|z)=\widehat{G}(3214|1-z)$, (C.15b)

and

$G(1234|z)=|z|^{2(h_{4}-h_{3}-h_{2}-h_{1})}G(1324|z^{-1})$, (C.16a)

$$\widehat{G}(1234|z)=|z|^{2(\hat{h}_{4}-\hat{h}_{3}-\hat{h}_{2}-\hat{h}_{1})}\widehat{G}(1324|z^{-1})\,$$ (C.16b)

where hi = Q2 2 + P 2 i and hˆ i = − Qb2 2 + Pb2 i . Similarly, the modular covariance of the torus one-point functions (7.2b) read,

$$\left\langle V_{P_{1}}(0)\right\rangle_{g=1}^{(-\frac{1}{\tau})}=|\tau|^{2h_{1}}\left\langle V_{P_{1}}(0)\right\rangle_{g=1}^{(\tau)}\,,$$ (C.17a)

$$\left\langle\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{1}}(0)\right\rangle_{g=1}^{(-\frac{1}{\tau})}=|\tau|^{2\hat{h}_{1}}\left\langle\widehat{V}_{\widehat{P}_{1}}(0)\right\rangle_{g=1}^{(\tau)}\,,$$ (C.17b)

where h1 = Q2 2 + P 2 1 and hˆ 1 = − Qb2 2 + Pb2 1 . (C.15), (C.16) and (C.17) may be directly verified numerically using the recursion relations described in this appendix.

## D Derivation of dilaton and string equations

In this appendix, we derive the dilaton and string equation (4.15a) and (4.15b) from the definition of the quantum volumes in terms of intersection numbers (4.14). This requires some algebraic geometry on Mg,n which we will explain in the derivation.

### D.1 Dilaton equation

We first derive the dilaton equation (4.15a). By definition, the left-hand-side equals

$$\text{LHS}=\int_{\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n+1}}\mathrm{e}^{\frac{c-13}{24}\kappa_{1}+\sum_{i}P_{i}^{2}\psi_{i}-\frac{c-1}{24}\psi_{n+1}-\sum_{m}\frac{B_{2m}}{(2m)(2m)!}\kappa_{2m}^{2m}}(\mathrm{e}^{\psi_{n+1}}-1)$$ (D.1) $$=\int_{\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n+1}}\psi_{n+1}\,\mathrm{e}^{\frac{c-13}{24}(\kappa_{1}-\psi_{n+1})+\sum_{i}P_{i}^{2}\psi_{i}-\sum_{m}\frac{B_{2m}}{(2m)(2m)!}(\kappa_{2m}-\psi_{n+1}^{2m})}\.$$

We used that we have by definition of the Bernoulli numbers

$${\rm e}^{x}-1=x\,{\rm e}^{\frac{x}{2}+\sum_{m\geq1}\frac{B_{2m}}{(2m)(2m)!}x^{2m}}$$ (D.2)

as a formal power series. The strategy is now to reduce the integral over Mg,n+1 to an integral over Mg,n, which means that we want to integrate out the fiber. This is precisely the definition of the pushforward π∗ by the forgetful map π : Mg,n+1 −→ Mg,n in cohomology. Thus we need to compute the pushforward of the integrand. The pushforward interacts with the pullback via the projection formula,

$\pi_{*}(\alpha\,\pi^{*}\beta)=(\pi_{*}\alpha)\,\beta\,\,.$

We can use this for our integrand with α = ψn+1. For β, we have to find a class which pulls back to the exponential. To do so, we first have to understand the behaviours of ψi and κm under pullback, which we explain here for completeness. See e.g. [177] for a more complete explanation.

We have

$\pi^{*}(\psi_{i})=\psi_{i}-\delta_{\{i,n+1\}}$.

Here δ{i,n+1} denotes the class in H2 (Mg,n+1) that is Poincar´e dual to the boundary divisor where the i-th and the (n + 1)-st point approach,

![](_page_99_Figure_6.jpeg)

(D.4) follows from the fact that the line bundle Li on Mg,n defining the ψ-classes (A.1) pulls back naturally to the corresponding line bundle on Mg,n+1. However, once we pass to the compactification, we have to be careful. sections of the line bundle Li are allowed to have simple poles at the boundary divisors. Since the pullback π ∗ (Li) does not see the (n + 1)-st marked point, we have to correct the formula by δ{i,n+1} to take this into account.

One can derive the pullback of κm from (D.4) as follows. Consider the maps

$$\begin{CD}\includegraphics[width=140.0pt]{28.45}\end{CD}$$ (D.6)

where π1 forgets the (n + 1)-st marked point and π2 forgets the (n + 2)-st marked point. We then have

$$\pi_{1}^{*}(\psi^{m+1}_{n+2})=(\psi_{n+2}-\delta_{\{n+1,n+2\}})^{m+1}=\psi^{m+1}_{n+2}-(-1)^{m}\delta^{m+1}_{\{n+1,n+2\}}\.$$ (D.7)

In the last step we used that the line bundle Ln+2 is trivial once we restrict it to the boundary divisor defined by δ{n+1,n+2} which implies that their product vanishes and thus there are no cross terms. We now pushforward this equation by the map π2. For this we first have to compute

$$(\pi_{2})_{*}(\delta^{m+1}_{\{n+1,n+2\}})=(\pi_{2})_{*}\big{(}\delta^{m}_{\{n+1,n+2\}}(\psi_{n+1}-\pi^{*}_{2}(\psi_{n+1}))\big{)}$$ (D.8) $$=-(\pi_{2})_{*}\big{(}\delta^{m}_{\{n+1,n+2\}}\ \pi^{*}_{2}(\psi_{n+1})\big{)}$$ $$=\psi_{n+1}(\pi_{2})_{*}(\delta^{m}_{\{n+1,n+2\}})$$ $$=(-1)^{m}\psi^{m+1}_{n+1}\ (\pi_{2})_{*}(\delta_{\{n+1,n+2\}})$$ $$=(-1)^{m}\psi^{m}_{n+1}\.$$

Here we used again the pullback (D.4) in the first line and the fact that ψn+1δ{n+1,n+2} = 0 in the second line. We then used the projection formula (D.3) and induction to reduce to the case m = 0. We then have (π2)∗(δ{n+1,n+2}) = 1 since the corresponding divisor intersects the fiber precisely once. Combining (D.7) and (D.8) gives

$$\pi_{1}^{*}\kappa_{m}=\pi_{1}^{*}(\pi_{2})_{*}(\psi_{n+2}^{m+1})=(\pi_{2})_{*}\pi_{1}^{*}(\psi_{n+2}^{m+1})=\kappa_{m}-\psi_{n+1}^{m}\.$$ (D.9)

Here we used the definition of κm, as well as the fact that we can commute the pullbacks and pushforwards of π1 and π2 since those fibers are independent. This is the desired pullback of κm.

Coming back to our original integrand (D.1), we realize that

$$\psi_{n+1}\ \pi^{*}\,{\rm e}^{\frac{c-1\lambda}{24}\kappa_{1}+\sum_{i}P_{i}^{2}\psi_{i}-\sum_{m}\frac{B_{nm}}{(m)(2m)!}\kappa_{2m}}$$ (D.10) $$=\psi_{n+1}\,{\rm e}^{\frac{c-1\lambda}{24}(\kappa_{1}-\psi_{n+1})+\sum_{i}P_{i}^{2}(\psi_{i}-\delta_{\{i,n+1\}}-\sum_{m}\frac{B_{nm}}{(2m)!(2m)!}(e_{2m}-\psi_{n+1}^{2m})$$ $$=\psi_{n+1}\,{\rm e}^{\frac{c-1\lambda}{24}(\kappa_{1}-\psi_{n+1})+\sum_{i}P_{i}^{2}\psi_{i}-\sum_{m}\frac{B_{nm}}{(2m)!(2m)!}(e_{2m}-\psi_{n+1}^{2m})}\,$$

where we used again that ψn+1 δ{i,n+1} = 0 and thus we can omit the boundary classes in the exponent. Hence the integrand is of the form of the projection formula (D.3). We thus have

$$\text{LHS}=\int_{\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{\theta,n}}\pi_{*}\Big{(}\psi_{n+1}\,\pi^{*}\,e^{\frac{c-13}{24}\kappa_{1}+\sum_{i}P_{i}^{2}\psi_{i}-\sum_{m}\frac{B_{2m}}{(2m)(2m)!}\kappa_{2m}}\Big{)}$$ (D.11) $$=\pi_{*}(\psi_{n+1})\int_{\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{\theta,n}}e^{\frac{c-13}{24}\kappa_{1}+\sum_{i}P_{i}^{2}\psi_{i}-\sum_{m}\frac{B_{2m}}{(2m)(2m)!}\kappa_{2m}}\Big{)}$$ $$=\pi_{*}(\psi_{n+1})\,\psi_{\theta,n}^{(0)}(\mathbf{P})\.$$

Here we used that π∗(ψn+1) has degree zero and can thus be identified with a number and taken out of the integral. The remaining integral is precisely again the definition of the quantum volume (4.14). It thus remains to compute π∗(ψn+1). By definition ψn+1 is the first Chern class of the line bundle Ln+1. A section of Ln+1 on the fiber is a holomorphic differential on the surface that is allowed to have poles at the marked points. The pushforward is then simply computing the degree of this line bundle. The degree of the canonical line bundle (the line bundle of holomorphic differentials) is known to be 2g − 2 and every marked point adds one to this. Thus

$\pi_{*}(\psi_{n+1})=2g-2+n$, (D.12)

which finishes the proof of the dilaton equation (4.15a).

### D.2 String equation

The derivation of the string equation (4.15b) is now very similar. The left hand side is equal to

LHS = Z Mg,n+1 e ψn+1 − 1 ψn+1 e c−13 24 κ1+ P i P 2 i ψi− c−1 24 ψn+1− P m B2m (2m)(2m)!κ2m = Z Mg,n+1 e c−13 24 (κ1−ψn+1)+P i P 2 i ψi− P m B2m (2m)(2m)! (κ2m−ψ 2m n+1) = Z Mg,n+1 e P i P 2 i δ{i,n+1} π ∗ e c−13 24 κ1+ P i P 2 i ψi− P m B2m (2m)(2m)!κ2m . (D.13)

We inserted again the definition of the Bernoulli numbers (D.2) and then used the same pullback as above. Contrary to before, we can however not omit the boundary classes since no ψn+1 prefactor is present. We thus compensated for them by including them in the prefactor. We can now pushforward to Mg,n and use the projection formula (D.3). This gives

LHS = Z Mg,n π∗ e P j P 2 j δ{j,n+1} e c−13 24 κ1+ P i P 2 i ψi− P m B2m (2m)(2m)!κ2m = Xn j=1 X k≥1 P 2k j k! Z Mg,n π∗ δ k {j,n+1} e c−13 24 κ1+ P i P 2 i ψi− P m B2m (2m)(2m)!κ2m = Xn j=1 X k≥1 P 2k j k! Z Mg,n (−ψj ) k−1 e c−13 24 κ1+ P i P 2 i ψi− P m B2m (2m)(2m)!κ2m = Xn j=1 Z Mg,n e P 2 j ψj − 1 ψj e c−13 24 κ1+ P i̸=j P 2 i ψi− P m B2m (2m)(2m)!κ2m = Xn j=1 Z Pj 0 (2Pj dPj ) Z Mg,n e c−13 24 κ1+ P i P 2 i ψi− P m B2m (2m)(2m)!κ2m = Xn j=1 Z Pj 0 (2Pj dPj ) V (b) g,n(P) . (D.14)

Going from the first line to the second line in (D.14) we used that the divisors corresponding to δ{i,n+1} and δ{j,n+1} do not intersect for i ̸= j and thus δ{i,n+1}δ{j,n+1} = 0 for i ̸= j. We can also omit the constant term in the power series expansion since π∗(1) = 0 for dimensional reasons. We then used the pushforward of the boundary classes derived in eq. (D.8). The rest is simple algebra and recognizing the definition of the quantum volume (4.14).
